# Copy: the text people read

Every string a person can read in RoleBand is either a message in one catalog
(`dashboard/src/copy/`) or text someone else wrote, shown as written. Messages are
written in a subset of [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/), compiled into
TypeScript functions, checked against the product's language rules, and
translated per message. Identifiers, API field names and URL paths are not copy.
Neither is a failure's technical reason: the native apps and Windows Setup show it
under the catalogued message that says what failed, in English as it was raised
(by the engine, Windows or the program itself), for the person to report.

---

## 1. The product language

### Who we write for

The reader is someone looking for their next role, at any level, and not technical
about this product: they never need to know what a scraper or a sync is. They
already have words for what it does (*role*, *posting*, *saved*, *applied*,
*level*, *not for me*). RoleBand uses their words and never makes them learn ours.

### The seven rules

1. **One thing, one word. One word, one thing.** A concept has one noun, one verb
   and one adjective, fixed across the product. A screen never renames it because
   a sentence reads better locally.
2. **Hierarchy words are not synonyms.** *Role* (the job), *posting* (the
   employer's document for it), *radar* (every role that concerns you) and
   *company* (who is hiring) are four different things and can share a sentence.
   Variety comes from naming the right level, never from swapping words at one
   level.
3. **The frame names it; the parts don't.** The page title, section heading or
   card names the object once. Controls inside it are bare verbs (*Save*,
   *Compare*, *Not for me*), because the noun is already on screen.
4. **The second mention is a pointer, not a noun:** *this role*, *it*, *both*.
   Never *this position* or *this opportunity*.
5. **Two of the same thing are told apart by their own facts, never by a label.**
   Compare's columns are headed by company and title; Duplicates shows *Earlier
   posting* and *Newer posting* with their dates. Never *Role A / Role B*.
6. **Say what happened, not how.** RoleBand reports outcomes: *Apple closed a role
   you saved*, *Scanned 12 minutes ago*. Implementation words never reach the
   screen.
7. **Nobody speaks.** Inside the app the subject of a sentence is the person,
   the thing, or nothing: *You start with well-known companies*, *Stripe is
   scanned when you choose Scan now*, *Couldn't add that company*. The app does
   not narrate itself, so neither *RoleBand* nor *we* is the subject. The name
   appears only as a name (the brand, *Open RoleBand*, the RoleBand folder),
   outside the app's own window (the menu bar app, macOS notifications, the
   installer, *RoleBand isn't answering*), where the reader may not know who is
   talking, and where a sentence must say who acts and nothing else is true
   (consent, and how a careers site sees the visitor: *It visits them openly, as
   RoleBand*). *We* is the people behind the project and appears only where they
   ask for something (*Help us improve*). Data that ships with the app is
   **built-in data**, set against a plugin's.

The metaphor is **radar**. It gives the product one place-word that is not the
object (*on your radar* is not *a role*), one verb for what RoleBand does
(*scan*), and one plain phrase for what a person's settings mean: **what your
radar looks for**.

### Words to know

`dashboard/src/copy/en/glossary.yaml` is the checked source of these rules
(`copy:check` reads it); this table is the handful you will meet first.

| Say | Never say | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **role** | position, opening, listing, job, opportunity, req | One open job at one company |
| **posting** | job post, listing, ad, requisition | The employer's document; a role can have several. **company** is who is hiring |
| **Radar** | Opportunities | The main board and the metaphor. *Opportunity* appears only in the brand line |
| **Total compensation**; *TC*, *Est. TC* in a column, row or chip | pay, total pay, comp, package | Base salary, bonus and equity for a year. *TC* never stands in a heading or a sentence, and always carries its full words for hover and screen readers |
| **Base salary**; *Base*, *Est. base* in a column, row or chip | base pay | |
| **Equity** | stock (for a grant) | *Stock* means the share price |
| **Posted range** | pay band, published band, disclosed band, stated pay | What an employer writes in a posting, named with its basis where known (*posted base range*). An employer *posts a range*; *Pay transparency* stays, as the legal term |
| **Comp band** | estimated pay, pay by level | A company's compensation at one level. A comp band is never a range, and a posted range is never a band |
| **Compensation** | pay | The topic as a whole: the Insights tab, a panel heading |
| **Minimum base** | pay floor | The yearly base salary a person sets as their lowest |
| **level** | seniority, band, career stage, tier | *Band* is a comp band only; the Strong to Weak fit groups are *fit grades* |
| **Career track**, **Discipline**, **World** | role kind, work style, role family, job family, position type | The settings for what your radar looks for |
| **Save** / **Not for me** / **Restore** | favorite, bookmark, dismiss, hide, reject | *Dismiss* is for notifications only |
| **Follow** (a company) | track, enable, activate | *Followed companies*, *Following* |
| **Scan** | sync, refresh, fetch, scrape, check | *Scan now*, *Scanned 3h ago*. *Check* means verification |
| **Best fit** (ranking) | best match, relevance, score, matching | *Match* means a search or filter hit, nothing else. The model behind Best fit is the *ranking model* |
| **More like this** | similar positions, related roles | *Related roles* is a Duplicates verdict |
| **Duplicates**: *Same role*, *Related roles*, *Different roles* | twin openings, same opening | |
| **coverage** | | The one word for whether RoleBand can read a company's careers page |
| **New** (a role) | today, just posted | Listed in the last 2 days: copy says *in the last 2 days*. *Closed* still says today |

Words for how RoleBand works are banned from screen: scrape, connector, adapter,
drift, lineage, inventory, catalog, persona, scope, sync, epoch, facet, hydrate,
endpoint, semantic, vector, embedding, payload, position, opening, pursuit, and
their inflections. The glossary also lists phrases that must not return (*role
family*, *best match*, *tracked role* and others), each term's Never list, and
the few files and phrases where an internal word is honest (the diagnostics
panel, a skill employers name such as *Vector Databases*).

### Mechanics

- No em-dash anywhere (U+2014). Use a comma, a full stop, a colon or parentheses.
- An ellipsis is one character (`…`), never three dots.
- Errors use contractions: *Couldn't*, *Don't*, *Doesn't*.
- Sentence case for labels, buttons and headings. Proper nouns listed in the
  glossary (`proper_nouns`) are exempt.

Every message declares a **kind**, and each kind has rules:

| Kind | Rules |
|---|---|
| `label` | sentence case, at most 4 words, no full stop |
| `button` | sentence case, at most 3 words, no full stop |
| `heading` | sentence case, no full stop |
| `link`, `aria`, `name` | no full stop (`name` is a taxonomy proper name: no case rule) |
| `sentence`, `empty`, `consent` | ends with a full stop |
| `error` | ends with a full stop, and its last sentence is one of the glossary's `next_steps` ("Try again.", "Check the link and try again." ...), or the comment says `next=none` |
| `toast`, `tooltip`, `notification`, `status` | full stop optional |

**When an error may end without a next step.** An error gives the one action
that works. It says `next=none` only when one of these is true, and its note
says which when the text does not make it plain:

1. The message is itself the instruction: *Type a time like 9:30.*
2. The thing is gone, and the screen drops it: *That notification is gone.*
3. What the person wanted is already true: *These postings are already linked.*
4. Nothing the person can do changes it: *That careers site limits automated
   collection, so it can't be added.*

Never end with *Try again.* when the cause won't change on a retry. A failure
put together from two messages (what failed, then why from the failure's code)
marks its first sentence `next=none` with a note, because the code adds the why
or *Try again.* after it; the why carries the next step, or fits one of the
four cases.

---

## 2. Where text lives

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `dashboard/src/copy/en/*.ftl` | The English catalog, one file per surface (`radar.ftl`, `role.ftl`, `settings.ftl`, `errors.ftl`, `notifications.ftl` ...) |
| `dashboard/src/copy/en/terms.ftl` | The nouns as Fluent terms (`-role`, `-posting`, `-company`), so the word lives once |
| `dashboard/src/copy/en/shared.ftl`, `common.ftl` | Words several screens share: `shared.ftl` for lazy screens only, `common.ftl` for words the app shell says |
| `dashboard/src/copy/en/vocab.ftl` | Names for every slug the API sends (see section 5) |
| `dashboard/src/copy/<locale>/` | A translation: the same message ids, its own `terms.ftl` and `glossary.yaml`, and `translated-from.json` |
| `dashboard/src/copy/locales.json` | The locale manifest: codes, names, direction, status, fallback chain, region list, and `englishOnly` message ids |
| `dashboard/src/copy/pinned.en.json` | Consent wording, pinned verbatim |
| `dashboard/src/copy/gen/` | Generated TypeScript. Git-ignored, never edited or committed |
| `dashboard/scripts/gen-copy.mjs`, `copy-check.mjs`, `copy/` | The compiler, the linter, the shared catalog model and the review deck |
| `dashboard/src/copy/runtime.ts`, `activate.ts`, `CopyBoundary.tsx` | Active language and region, loading, live switching |

---

## 3. Adding or changing a message

### Write it in the catalog

New user-facing text is always a message, never a literal in a component. Pick
the surface's `.ftl` file under `dashboard/src/copy/en/` and add the message with
a comment that declares its kind:

```ftl
# kind=button
radar-show-all = Show all

# kind=status note="A count of roles: 219 roles"
shared-count-role = { $count ->
    [one] { $count } { -role(num: "one") }
   *[other] { $count } { -role(num: "other") }
}
```

The comment carries metadata as `key=value` pairs:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | Required. One of the kinds in section 1 |
| `note` | Context for a translator or reviewer, when the intent is not obvious |
| `next=none` | An error that has no next step to offer, or the first sentence of a failure whose next step the code adds after it: why it failed, from the failure's code, or *Try again.* when nothing explains it (its note says so) |
| `same-as=<id>` | Two messages in one file with the same kind and text that must stay separate (otherwise `copy:check` asks you to merge them) |
| `wording=as-is` | The wording has not been reviewed against the rules. `copy:check` reports its wording problems instead of blocking, and blocks if the text is not in `dashboard/src/test/copy-as-found.json`. New messages never carry it; rewording one drops the marker |

Keep ids stable. The same words in different contexts do not have to share a
message, but one surface never repeats a shared word: use `shared.ftl` or
`common.ftl`.

A file whose resource comment starts `### eager` is imported by the shell, so
every message in it ships in the startup chunk. Put a message there only if the
shell says it. A file marked `### keyed` (`vocab.ftl`) also exports a lookup by
key, for messages chosen by data.

**The Fluent subset.** Text, `{ $variables }`, selects on a plural category or a
string, terms with literal arguments (`{ -role(num: "one") }`), term attributes as
selectors, and message attributes. Anything else fails the build with the file and
line. Metadata goes in the comment, never in attributes. A message whose selects
expand past 4,096 combinations fails too: split it.

### Call the generated function

`gen:copy` turns each message into a function named after its id, exported from
a module named after its file: `radar-show-all` in `radar.ftl` is
`radarShowAll()` from `copy/gen/radar`. A message with variables takes them as an
object (`sharedCountRole({ count })`), and a numeric variable is formatted for the
reader's region. A selector's argument is always data.

`npm install`, `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `test:unit` and `test:ux` regenerate
`src/copy/gen/` first, and the Vite plugin (`scripts/copy/vite-plugin.mjs`) does
on edit. A bare `npx tsc` in a fresh checkout needs `npm run gen:copy` first.

A sentence with a link or emphasis inside stays one message, rendered with
`<Msg of={message} args={...} elems={{ link: <a ...>...</a> }} />`, so a
translation places the element where its grammar needs it. Never split a
sentence across JSX around `{expr}`.

### Resolve text at render

A language switch remounts the UI (section 6), so text must be computed during
render, never kept:

- No message call in module scope, React state, refs, context values above
  `CopyBoundary`, or caches. Keep keys, slugs or the message function instead.
- A module-level table uses getters, so each read calls the message:
  `get label() { return shellNavRadar(); }`.
- A toast stores its message function and parameters, not the text.

### Tests name the message, not the words

A test asserts text with `msg("radar-show-all", args)` from
`dashboard/src/test/msg.ts`, with a literal key (ESLint enforces it). Fixture data
(company names, titles, cities) stays literal. A copy edit then does not break
tests, but a behaviour change still does.

---

## 4. Text RoleBand did not write

**Third-party text** (a role's title, a company's name, a city, an employer's
section heading) renders through `<Content text={...} />` from
`dashboard/src/ui/Content.tsx`. It marks the span `translate="no"`,
`data-copy="content"` and `dir="auto"`, so it is never translated, a Latin name
cannot reorder a right-to-left sentence, and the pseudo-locale scan knows it is
not missing copy. `Content` takes a string, never children, and is the only place
`translate=` may be written (ESLint). As an accessible name, the same mark is
`data-copy="content"` (or `labelIsContent` on `ui/Switch`).

**Engineering text** shown behind the diagnostics toggle (run notes, raw
counters) renders through `Diagnostic` in the same file: English, untranslated,
outside the language rules.

**Numbers, money, dates, durations, lists and sorting** go through
`dashboard/src/copy/format.ts` (`number`, `money`, `date`, `duration`, `list`,
`compare`, `parseNumber` and others). Numbers and currency follow
the reader's region; words and collation follow the language; dates and lists
use both. Never call `toLocaleString`, `new Intl.*` or `localeCompare` in a
component; `copy:check` counts those habits per folder and the count only falls.

---

## 5. What the backend sends

The backend sends codes, slugs and third-party content. It does not send English
for a person to read, except the few records and banners below.

### API errors are codes

A router raises

```python
raise api_error(404, ErrorCode.JOB_NOT_FOUND, "job not found")
```

from `backend/tracker/api/errors.py`, never `HTTPException`. The response detail
is `{"code": "job-not-found", "params": {...}, "message": "job not found"}`:
`message` is English for logs and MCP clients, and `params` carries slugs, never
display names. `backend/tests/test_api_error_codes.py` fails on any
`HTTPException` built elsewhere under `tracker/api`.

To add an error:

1. Add a kebab-case member to `ErrorCode`.
2. Regenerate the API types (`.venv/bin/python -m scripts.export_openapi` in
   `backend/`, then `npm run gen:api` in `dashboard/`).
3. Add `error-<code>` to `dashboard/src/copy/en/errors.ftl` (`kind=error`).
4. Add the code to `BY_CODE` in `dashboard/src/api/errorText.ts`. It is typed as
   a record over every code, so `tsc -b` fails until you do.

A screen says a failure with `errorText(caught, fallback)`, never `.message`. A
failure that explains nothing (a crash, a malformed request, an unexplained
server error) shows the screen's own `fallback` sentence, or the generic line.

### Product words travel as slugs

Taxonomy values (worlds, tracks, role groups, sectors, skills, sources) reach the
dashboard as slugs. `dashboard/src/copy/vocab.ts` names them from `vocab.ftl`
(`domainName`, `trackName`, `roleName`, `sectorName`, `skillName`,
`sourceName`), by the key `vocab-<kind>-<slug>`. A new slug ships its message in
the same change: `backend/tests/test_vocab_catalog.py` reads every slug table and
fails on one with no message.

### Every API string field declares a text class

A response field that carries text declares what kind it is:

```python
title: str = Field(json_schema_extra=text("content"))
```

with `text` from `backend/tracker/api/schemas/text_class.py`; it reaches
`openapi.json` as `x-text`. The classes: `code` (a code or slug the dashboard
turns into words), `content` (third-party text, shown through `Content`),
`record` (stored as agreed or as it happened, such as a consent), `diagnostic`,
and `identifier` (an id, URL or path).

`backend/tests/test_api_text_classes.py` fails on any string field with a
word-like name (`title`, `label`, `reason`, `name` ...) that declares none. The
count is zero and stays there.

### Notifications are said twice

A notification row stores English `title` and `body` (the fallback for older
rows, what feed search matches, what diagnostics shows) and, beside them,
`meta.say`: the same sentences as catalog keys with parameters. The dashboard
renders `meta.say` in the reader's language through `notificationText`
(`dashboard/src/api/notificationText.ts`), the only place it reads notification
text, and falls back to the stored English for a row without a usable `say`.

The English is not written twice by hand: `npm run gen:copy` compiles the
`notif-` and `banner-` messages into
`backend/tracker/notifications/catalog_gen.py` (committed), and producers build
descriptors with `say(key, **params)` from `backend/tracker/notifications/say.py`.
A parameter is third-party content, a number, a calendar day (`day(date)`), or a
nested `say` for a phrase the product words itself.

To add a sentence:

1. Add the `notif-` message to `dashboard/src/copy/en/notifications.ftl`.
2. Add its key and parameter names to `backend/tests/fixtures/notification_keys.json`.
   Keys are a contract with stored rows: never remove one or reuse it for another
   meaning; a rewording keeps its key.
3. Run `npm run gen:copy`, which regenerates `catalog_gen.py` and fails if the
   parameters differ from the registry.
4. Add a sample to `backend/scripts/export_notification_samples.py` and run
   `.venv/bin/python -m scripts.export_notification_samples` from `backend/`.
   It writes `dashboard/src/api/notification-samples.json`, which
   `notificationText.test.ts` renders and compares with the stored English.

`backend/tests/test_notification_say.py` fails on a stale samples file, an
unregistered key, or a registered key with no sample.

**Operating-system banners** use the `banner-` messages in English only, so
reporting a database failure never needs a database read for the language.

**Backend prose outside the catalog** (in notification and banner producers) is
held to the same banned words and mechanics by `backend/tests/test_copy_glossary.py`,
against `backend/tests/fixtures/copy_glossary.gen.json`, the glossary copy
`gen:copy` writes. Known problems are named in a baseline that only shrinks.

---

## 6. Languages

### Language and region

Language and region are two settings. Language picks the catalog; region picks
how numbers, dates and lists are written (`1,219` or `1.219`, `12 Apr` or
`Apr 12`). People choose both in Settings › Language and region. The account's
choice lives in the settings store (`GET`/`PUT /api/settings/locale`) and is
mirrored in the browser (`localStorage` key `roleband.locale`) so the first paint
is already in the right language. With nothing stored, the browser's languages
are matched against the manifest. Language tags are validated on both sides; the
backend's grammar is `backend/tracker/platform/language_tags.py`.

English is compiled inline: each message function wraps its English with the
active table, so the table wins and English is the per-message fallback. Every
other locale is one lazy table, loaded only when chosen. A switch (`activate`)
loads the table, sets `<html lang dir>`, and changes the key of `CopyBoundary`,
which sits inside the data providers and remounts everything below them. The URL,
providers and server state survive; component-local state (a half-typed search)
does not. That remount is why text must be resolved at render (section 3).

### Locale status

| Status | Build and checks | At runtime | In the picker |
|---|---|---|---|
| `complete` | A missing message fails `gen:copy`; stale, untracked and kind problems block `copy:check` | Never falls back | Listed |
| `beta` | A missing message is reported, not blocking. Stale and untracked messages are reported by `copy:check` and fail `npm run test:unit`, so a change to what an English message says lands with its translations. Structural problems block | Falls back per message along its `fallback` chain, then to English | Listed |
| `pseudo` | Generated from English | `en-XA` (accented, padded, bracketed) and `keys` (each message shows its id) | Listed only on a device with `localStorage` `roleband.copy-check` set to `1` |

English is `complete`; Spanish (`es`) and Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`) are
`beta`. A fallback message keeps the plural grammar of the language it is written
in, while digits follow the reader's region.

### Adding or updating a translation

A translation is the same message id in `dashboard/src/copy/<locale>/<file>.ftl`,
with no metadata comment (it inherits the English message's kind). It must keep
the English message's contract: no variable English does not pass, every
displayed count and action, and the same terms (a synonym for `-role` fails).
It may drop a selector that only exists for English grammar, and it carries
every plural category its language needs (Spanish states `many` wherever a
message states its own count: "1.000.000 de puestos").

`<locale>/translated-from.json` records, per message, a fingerprint of the
English it is a translation of: the English pattern, every term and attribute it
reaches, and its kind. Reflowing the English or editing its comment changes
nothing; changing what it says, or a term it uses, makes the translation
**stale**, and `npm run test:unit` fails until it is re-translated and recorded:

```sh
# re-translate, then record each message you re-translated:
npm run copy:check -- --translated es radar-show-all shared-count-role
# record every new translation (stale ones stay stale unless named):
npm run copy:check -- --translated es
```

A translation that breaks its contract can be held in
`dashboard/src/copy/translation-quarantine.json` with its exact pattern: the
runtime shows the English message until it is repaired, and the repair removes
the entry in the same change. A `complete` locale cannot hold quarantines.

**Editorial review** is separate from translation tracking. After a person reads a
translation against the rules, record it by id:

```sh
npm run copy:deck -- --reviewed es radar-show-all
```

That writes `<locale>/reviewed-from.json` with hashes of the English, the
translation and the rules; any of them changing makes the review stale.
Never mark messages reviewed in bulk.

### Adding a language

1. Add a row to `dashboard/src/copy/locales.json` with `status: "beta"`, its
   direction and its fallback chain. Add any regions to `regions`.
2. Add `dashboard/src/copy/<locale>/` with its `terms.ftl` and a `glossary.yaml`
   in that language (banned words, mechanics, form of address under `register`,
   its `next_steps`).
3. Declare the locale table's raw and gzip budget in
   `dashboard/copy-bundle-baseline.json`; the build refuses a language without one.
4. If the script is not Latin, Cyrillic, Greek or Vietnamese, add a font package.
5. No component branches on language.

Before a locale becomes `complete`: no blocking or stale diagnostics, a native
speaker's review, layouts checked at narrow and desktop widths, real glyphs in
the font, and the bundle gate (`en-XA` proves neither fonts nor layout for
another script).

### Consent wording is pinned

Consent wording (the warning before following a company whose site limits
automated collection, the agreement before following a company read only when
its user asks, and usage sharing) is `kind=consent` and
pinned verbatim in `dashboard/src/copy/pinned.en.json`. `copy:check` blocks if a
pinned message changes or a consent message is not pinned. They change only by a
deliberate, reviewed decision, never as a side effect of copy work.

The follow dialog's "Keep scanning" switch is a setting, not consent wording: the
API stores its answer as `tracked_company.scan_on_schedule`, the person changes it
later from the company's row, and its label and hint are translated like any other
control. The agreement's stored text is the dialog's title and paragraphs.

The native launcher's automatic-check toggle label is also pinned and kept in
English. Its preferences record the exact label and time when a person changes
the choice; leaving the default-off toggle untouched creates no agreement record.

Consent is never machine translated. Consent ids are in `englishOnly` in
`locales.json`, and `gen:copy` fails if any locale translates one. The dialog
captures the exact text it rendered and its language, and the API stores both
with the record (for a followed company, `tracked_company.consent_text` and
`consent_locale`), so a later language switch never rewrites the agreement.

## 7. Commands and what fails when

Run from `dashboard/`:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run gen:copy` | Compile the catalog into `src/copy/gen/`, and write the committed backend files (`catalog_gen.py`, `copy_glossary.gen.json`). `-- --check` writes nothing and exits 1 if anything is stale |
| `npm run copy:check` | Lint every locale's catalog and the remaining literals; exit 1 on a blocking problem |
| `npm run copy:check -- --translated <locale> [id ...]` | Record translations (section 6) |
| `npm run copy:check -- --freeze` | Lower the literal baseline after a change reduced it; refuses to raise a count or freeze a blocking catalog |
| `npm run copy:deck` | Export the review deck to `node_modules/.cache/copy-review/`; with the dev server running, browse it at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/__copy-review/` |
| `npm run copy:deck -- --since <ref>` | Also write the messages changed after a git ref, with their dependents |
| `npm run copy:deck -- --reviewed <locale> <id ...>` | Record an editorial review |

What fails, and where:

| Check | Fails on |
|---|---|
| `gen:copy` (every npm hook, the dev server, the build) | Unparseable FTL; Fluent outside the subset; a duplicate id or term; a translation using a variable English does not pass, or breaking its contract unquarantined; a translation of an `englishOnly` message; a `complete` locale missing a message; a notification key with no message or different parameters; too many select combinations |
| `copy:check` and `src/test/copy-check.test.ts` (in `test:unit`) | English: any rule in section 1, a duplicate message, a changed pin, an unpinned consent. Translations: their glossary, term parity, contract; in a `complete` locale also stale, untracked, plural and kind problems. Literals: a new problem, or a per-folder count in `src/test/copy-check-baseline.json` rising (the counts below) |
| `src/copy/compiler.test.ts` | Generated files stale against the catalogs (including the backend's committed twins), or generated files committed |
| `npm run lint` | `msg()` with a non-literal key; `translate=` outside `ui/Content` |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -b` (an error code with no `BY_CODE` entry); a locale table over its `copy-bundle-baseline.json` budget, or a locale with none (`scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`) |
| `npm run test:ux` | Unbracketed text in the `en-XA` pseudo locale: `tests/ux/copy-locale.spec.ts` switches live on every route, `tests/ux/copy-screens.spec.ts` boots each screen state into it. Plain text there is copy missing from the catalog or third-party text not marked with `Content`. A new screen state joins `copy-screens` |
| Backend `pytest` | `test_api_error_codes.py`, `test_api_text_classes.py`, `test_vocab_catalog.py`, `test_notification_say.py`, `test_copy_glossary.py` (section 5) |

`copy:check` prints advisory output (beta translations, `wording=as-is`
problems) as `report` lines, which never fail; failures print as `BLOCK`, `NEW`
(literal problem) or `RATCHET` (count rise).

The literal scan (`scripts/copy/extract.mjs`) reads every source file with the
TypeScript compiler and counts, per folder:
