"""Which tiers of a gate workflow a change needs.

A pull-request gate takes no `paths:` filter: a required check from a filtered workflow
waits forever on a change the filter skips. Its first job runs this script instead, and a
job that is not needed reports as skipped, which counts as passed.

The watched paths come from the workflow, one GitHub glob per line: `**` crosses `/`, `*`
and `?` do not. `backend/tests/test_ci_workflow_triggers.py` holds that each list covers
every file its tier's steps read.

The Mac workflow names two tiers (`NATIVE_PATHS`, `BUNDLE_PATHS`) and gates pushes too. The
bundle never runs for a pull request; it is the slow tier, and every release builds it.
Any other workflow names one tier (`TIER`, `PATHS`), which only a pull request can skip
unless `SKIP_EVENTS` names the events that may skip it: CodeQL's Swift scan lets a push skip
too, since no required check waits on it.

Anything this script cannot judge runs everything: a release, a manual or scheduled run, a
push with no previous commit, or a diff git cannot produce.
