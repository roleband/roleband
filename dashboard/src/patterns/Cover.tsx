/* The Cover (docs/ui.md "Cover"): a full-viewport surface for
 * studying one thing, or a few, over the list it was opened from. Job detail
 * is its first occupant; Compare its second.
 *
 * Two shells, one body — because the two are different things to a keyboard
 * and a screen reader. Opened from a list it covers a page that stays MOUNTED
 * underneath (the list keeps its scroll and filters; Back pops history), so it
 * is a modal dialog: ui/Overlay owns role, aria-modal, focus capture/trap/
 * restore, Escape and the body scroll lock. Reached by URL or refresh it IS
 * the page — its one `main` landmark — and Escape is this component's to own,
 * as a `page` layer (ui/escapeLayer): one layer per cover whichever shell, or
 * onBack runs twice and steps back two entries; and anything opened over the
 * page (the palette) takes the press first.
 *
 * No scrim: the cover is opaque, so a dim layer under it would paint nothing
 * and a click-to-close target would sit over a page you cannot see.
 *
 * `data-design-system="app"` stays on the cover in BOTH shells: the rules in
 * design/surfaces.css and design/dataviz.css are gated on it, so a shell that
 * drops it silently unstyles the panels inside. */
