// Single UI icon set for the whole dashboard.
//
// Backed by `lucide-react` (Feather's maintained continuation, ISC).
//
// NAMES ARE OURS, not Lucide's. The indirection is the point: it keeps call
// sites off upstream's naming churn (upstream renames glyphs, such as
// `help-circle` -> `circle-question-mark`), so a rename there is a one-line
// edit here.
//
// Brand/company marks are NOT in this set — Lucide carries no company logos.
// Those live in `CompanyIcon.tsx`, backed by Simple Icons.
// Canonical Lucide names only — the older `XCircle`/`HelpCircle`/`CheckCircle2`
// aliases still resolve but are deprecated upstream.
