   would be display-only surfaces whose facts live where the user acts — so
   Direction, the radar's steering wheel, is all that renders here. Your
   experience is reached through the Summary's CV action; no tabbar is needed.
   `useTabRoute` owns the `/profile/:tab` slug, which redirects any other
   `/profile/...` deep link here instead of dead-ending.

   Direction is the walk: five screens, one question each, and a
   sheet that writes the answer back. It owns its own two-column layout and
   folds it at the settings shell's breakpoint, so the shell here is only the
   head. Rendered inside the settings design scope, which owns the
   select-card and rail families.

   First-run setup is this same walk (routing/setupMode.ts): it starts blank,
   ends on the companies step the route hands in, and draws its own header,
   which says how far along setup is; that header's one action is the way
   out. */
