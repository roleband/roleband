/* The front door of first-run setup: the radar intro (the product narrative
   as a scene, not a form), then the usage-sharing question, then Profile's
   own walk in setup mode (routing/setupMode.ts). Setup is the walk every
   configured install edits later, so there is no second copy of its steps
   here to drift from it.

   The sharing question (docs/architecture.md) is asked BEFORE the walk, so a
   person who shares has the walk itself counted; nothing is counted before
   the answer. It is asked inside the intro's scene: the planet dims and the
   question takes the place of the intro's words. Skipped when nothing is left to ask, when an environment switch
   has turned sharing off, or when the state cannot be read (a failed read
   never blocks setup).

   The intro's planet is lazy: d3 and the world atlas load only when it shows. */
