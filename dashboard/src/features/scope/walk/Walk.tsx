/* Profile › Looking for as a walk.
 *
 * A path of five screens, one question each: the kind of role, the level,
 * where — the three that decide what reaches the radar — then two optional
 * ones that sharpen it, which roles exactly and the interests. A sixth entry,
 * Summary, is the whole answer in one place and the place to judge it: the
 * choices, the funnel they produced, and the way back to any step. After the
 * third answer the walk lands there (the gate and the summary are one
 * screen).
 *
 * Above, the steps as the app's tab bar. Below it, the one question of the
 * current step, in a step card: a banded head, the question, the
 * note, and a body whose frame is the same size for the three answers that
 * decide, so Back and Continue never move. At the right, the rail: what the
 * radar keeps, and Save.
 *
 * Only the current step is rendered. The rail holds words and one Save,
 * never a question. That is the whole anti-wall rule.
 *
 * First-run setup (`setup`) is the same walk taken straight through: the three
 * answers that decide, the two that sharpen, the Summary of all five, and a
 * last step on which companies to scan, handed in by the route because it is
 * Companies' own. The draft starts blank, the rail offers no Save, and the
 * companies step's Start is the one commit: the scope, then the pay floor the
 * Summary holds. Setup has the window to itself,
 * so the walk draws its own header (the step it is on, and the way out) and
 * stands as one centred column a little below the top.
 *
 * Setup's step lives in the browser's history, one entry per step, so Back
 * (the browser's, or a phone's back gesture) steps back through setup rather
 * than out of RoleBand, and a reload opens the step it left. Its answers are
 * kept for the tab until Start (../setupStash).
 *
 * The two that sharpen say they are optional, and while one still keeps
 * everything a quieter Skip sits beside Continue. Continue stays where it is
 * on every step, so a reader who presses it from habit still moves on; both
 * keep everything, since a blank draft keeps every role of each kind and
 * every world. */
