/* The dial's drag machine: pointer capture, the click latch, the live draft,
   and the one write the whole surface makes.

   It is a hook rather than a module of functions because every part of it is
   state the dial renders from — and because the three refs are the whole
   correctness story. `pointerRef` is what makes a second pointer on a second
   mark a no-op; `suppressClickRef` is what stops the click that follows a
   drag from also opening the inspector; `stageRef` is what turns a client
   coordinate into a minute. None of them can live in the component that draws
   the marks, because that component is re-created by every state change the
   drag causes. */

/* Pointer capture is what keeps a drag alive once the pointer leaves the 24px
   mark: without it the browser stops delivering moves and ups to the handle
   and the gesture dies where the cursor crosses the edge. That is held, in a
   real browser, by the two mouse drags in `tests/ux/schedule.spec.ts`. It is
   NOT held by any component test, and cannot be: jsdom implements neither
   method, so `ScheduleChronograph.test.tsx` stubs them and dispatches every
   pointer event at the mark directly.

   Both are guarded because both can throw on a pointer the browser does not
   count as active: `releasePointerCapture` is specified to raise
   NotFoundError for a pointerId that matches no active pointer, and it runs
   in the pointerup handler, before the persist call. Unguarded, one throw
   would drop the write the drag exists to make, silently. */
