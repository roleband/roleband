 * The read model behind live sync progress: parse, clock, predicates.
 *
 * The pipeline collects every source concurrently *before* it writes anything,
 * so `ScrapeRun.jobs_seen` stays at zero for the longest phase of a run: a run
 * minutes deep into hydration looks identical to a stalled one. The backend
 * publishes counters into `notification.meta.progress` (heartbeat during
 * collect, inline per company during persist); this module turns them into a
 * typed snapshot and answers the questions the views ask of it.
 *
 * Parse defensively: meta is untyped JSONB, a row may have no `progress` block
 * at all, and a `progress` block may have no `companies` array, which is why
 * the panel keeps a complete aggregate-only rendering path.
 *
 * It lives apart from `SyncProgressPanel` because the panel's own children
 * (`SyncStream`, `SyncContribution`) need these types and predicates, and
 * importing them from the panel module would import the composition root that
 * renders them: an import cycle `import-x/no-cycle` refuses.
