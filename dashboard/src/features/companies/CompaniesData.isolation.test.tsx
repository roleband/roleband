/* The register's render isolation.
 *
 * `useSyncStatus()` returns a value that is REPLACED every poll, every 3 seconds
 * while a scrape runs. One context object carrying the whole screen and that
 * value would hand every register row a new value on each tick, for state almost
 * none of them read. Every register row reads this context to build its
 * view's props, so the re-render reaches every row.
 *
 * These are render COUNTS, and that is deliberate: a `useMemo` on a provider
 * value that subscribes to the poll would look like a fix and still produce a
 * new identity every 3s. What holds is the poll-derived pair in its own context,
 * keyed on `syncRunning`, a BOOLEAN a tick does not usually change. A
 * structural assertion could not tell those two apart; a render count can.
