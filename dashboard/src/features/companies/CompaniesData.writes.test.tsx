/* Every write this register makes, and what happens when they overlap.
 *
 * Neither control is disabled while its write is in flight — only the row's
 * `aria-busy` moves — so a second click during one is an ordinary interaction,
 * and the value it sends is computed from the row, which still shows the
 * pre-write state. Two writes in the air and the state the install keeps is
 * decided by which reply the server handled last.
 *
 * TWO shapes, which is the whole reason there is a queue and not a chain. The
 * eye PATCHes one row, so two rows must not wait on each other. The switch
 * PUTs one change but is answered with the WHOLE roster, which the screen
 * adopts, so it must order against every outstanding write in both directions:
 * the reply carries a `visible` for every company, so a row PATCH that lands
 * beside it is echoed away with nothing left to correct it.
 *
 * So the boundary here HOLDS what it was told, per company AND for the roster,
 * behind a gate the test opens by call index. A call list cannot answer the
 * only question that matters — what the install ended up with. It also snapshots
 * its reply when the request ARRIVES rather than when its gate opens, because
 * that is what makes an overlapping write observable at all: a server reads,
 * then commits, and the echo is fixed by the read.
