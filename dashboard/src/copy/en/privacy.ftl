## Usage sharing: the consent screen and Settings > Privacy (docs/architecture.md).
## "us", not the product's name; the lead gives a reason to help (a free, open-source project
## that improves every release); one warm answer, "Happy to help", that shares every kind
## listed, and "No thanks" beside it. Nothing is pre-ticked: a ticked box is not a consent
## (CJEU Planet49), so choosing kinds is a link that opens clear boxes. RoleBand records no
## sessions. The consent sentences are pinned (pinned.en.json): the screen stores exactly
## these words as what was agreed.
