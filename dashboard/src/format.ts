/* Count badges: a real number, or something that does not pretend to be one.
 *
 * `99+` alone is not a policy when one badge lives above it permanently. The
 * Review rail count is the pending duplicate/twin queue (`review_pending`),
 * which every scrape refills, so a `99+` badge saturates on day one and never
 * settles again: a red light that cannot turn off, carrying no information
 * past "a lot". A count badge is a call to action, and a call to action that
 * is always on is chrome.
 *
 * So the cap is where the badge STOPS CLAIMING to be a count rather than where
 * it starts lying about one: at or below it, the exact number; above it, a dot
 * — presence without a magnitude nobody can act on. The exact count is never
 * lost, because `label` is what every caller must put in the tooltip and the
 * accessible name at both sizes. That is also the first time a rail count is
 * announced at all: the rail items and the bell carry an `aria-label`, which
 * overrides their subtree, so the digits inside were never read out.
 *
 * 99 is the cap because it is the widest count the existing 17px badge box
 * holds without reflowing the rail or the bell.
