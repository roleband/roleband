/* `import-x/no-cycle` is an error with no allowlist, which makes it the one gate
 * whose passing state is indistinguishable from its broken state: a clean tree
 * reports nothing, and so does a rule that has silently stopped resolving.
 *
 * The rule needs `settings['import-x/parsers']` to parse the modules a file
 * imports; the resolver alone only answers which FILE a specifier names.
 * Configured with the resolver and nothing else, a two-file cycle in `src/`
 * lints clean, and `npm run lint` says "no issues" for the opposite reason.
 * Deleting that one settings key would do it, and no other test in this suite
 * would notice.
 *
 * So the gate is checked from the failing end: lint a pair of modules that
 * really do import each other and require the error by name.
