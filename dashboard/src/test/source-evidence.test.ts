/* Where a fact's evidence is allowed to live.
 *
 * A test that reads a stylesheet as TEXT is not testing the app; it is testing
 * what the app's source SAYS. That is the right instrument for exactly four
 * kinds of fact, all of which a browser either cannot see or cannot see
 * cheaply:
 *
 *   token-vocabulary — computed style shows `16px` whether it came from
 *     --app-space-4 or a literal, and `line-height: 1.5` whether it was
 *     declared or inherited. The distinction only exists in the source.
 *   selector-absence — you cannot render the rule that ISN'T there. A gate
 *     against a fork, a dead selector, or a doorway class nobody passes has
 *     no DOM to look at.
 *   cascade — which rule WON, and by how much. The browser paints the winner
 *     and says nothing about the margin, so a 0-2-0 tie decided by load order
 *     looks identical to a rule that outranks its rival.
 *   ownership — which module imports/declares what. An architecture fact.
 *
 * Everything else — interaction, focus behaviour, geometry as PAINTED,
 * accessibility — belongs in a component test or a Playwright spec, where it
 * is measured rather than read.
 *
 * Two gates, because the charter alone would be self-certifying.

 * Adding a row is the review. If the honest answer is "it renders and then
 * checks what it looks like", the file does not belong here at all.
 *
 * The seven `.tsx` rows are HYBRIDS, and they are the pattern the rest of this
 * charter is arguing for rather than an exception to it: ui/Button, Select,
 * TabBar, Toast and friends render for every behavioural fact (focus, keys,
 * aria, disabled) and read the sheet for the two facts rendering cannot reach —
 * "paints --app-* only" and "sizes from the control scale, never a literal".
 * Same file, one instrument each, chosen by what the fact is.
