/* The shell tier's two boundaries, checked from the FAILING end.
 *
 * An import zone is the one kind of gate whose passing state is
 * indistinguishable from its broken state: a zone whose target directory does
 * not exist matches nothing and reports nothing, which reads exactly like a
 * clean tree. A list like `FEATURES` can name a deleted directory and omit
 * live ones with nothing saying so; the resolver and the parser settings have
 * the same shape.
 *
 * Renaming a tier is precisely when this bites: every zone naming the old
 * directory silently stops enforcing anything the moment it is gone. So both
 * shell zones carry a fixture that really commits the violation, and the rule
 * is required to fire on it by name.
