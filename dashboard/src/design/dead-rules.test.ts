/* The dead-rules gate.
 *
 * A screen rebuild deletes components and leaves their CSS. Dead rules are
 * invisible precisely because they look deliberate, so a one-time sweep
 * re-rots on the next rebuild: a class selector is only as good as the test
 * that something still renders it.
 *
 * For every class selector in a stylesheet under src/, some non-test source
 * file must reference the class. Composed names — `ui-badge-${tone}`,
 * `is-${tone}` — are the one hard part: the gate
 * carries a FROZEN prefix allowlist, and adding a row is a claim that a
 * component composes that family by interpolation (the composing file is
 * named beside each row; rows whose composer dies must go with it). The
 * tradeoff is explicit: a dead `.is-*` variant hides behind its family row,
 * so keep the families narrow.
