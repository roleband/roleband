/* Viewport breakpoints are a closed set, so a screen cannot pick a new one
 * without a check noticing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE IS NOT. It is not a scale, and declaring one would be wrong:
 * the values disagree for a structural reason rather than a sloppy one.
 * Nearly every value outside the shell asks "how wide is this COMPONENT?"
 * while measuring the viewport, and the offset between the two steps at the
 * shell's own breakpoints. So a screen's number is a component width plus
 * whatever chrome was in force, and different screens sit behind different
 * chrome: two tabs of the same screen can make one decision at two numbers.
 *
 * The answer is `@container`, which the Board's column arms use
 * (`board-shell.test.ts` keeps them there), and this gate is the ratchet
 * toward it without a bulk rewrite: the set may only SHRINK. A new value fails by name; a value
 * whose last consumer migrates to `@container` must leave this list in the same
 * change, or it is permitted to come back.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated: `@container` widths. Those are the destination, and
 * freezing them would tax the migration this exists to encourage.
