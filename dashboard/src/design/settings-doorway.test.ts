/* The doorway gate.
 *
 * The overlay primitives (ui/Dialog, ui/Popover, ui/Sheet) paint from
 * `--app-*`; there is one vocabulary and no scope to cross. `app-overlay` is
 * the one app-wide class a portalled overlay passes, on any route, including
 * routes with no Settings marker (the bell popover): a class marks a surface
 * as ours, while a route marker only marks where the surface was opened from.
 * What is asserted: every overlay passes the class, each primitive states its
 * own chrome, and a wearer only REFINES it.
 *
 * The class cannot be enforced by the CSS that consumes it, which is the whole
 * reason for this file: a selector that depends on a className is only as good
 * as the test that the className is still passed.
