/**
 * Is this request one the unmocked-API guard should refuse?
 *
 * The glob below (`** slash api slash **`) is a coarse pre-filter, and it
 * cannot tell an API
 * call from a source file that happens to live under `src/api/`. Vite's dev
 * server serves every module at its own URL, and `src/api/` is a real
 * directory (the typed client, split by domain), so the glob matches
 * `/src/api/index.ts` and a guard on it alone throws on a MODULE FETCH: every
 * test fails on the dev-server path, invisibly to CI, which serves the built
 * artifact, where no `/src/...` URL exists.
 *
 * The rule is narrower than "ignore Vite's prefixes": our API is served at
 * `/api/...` on the app's own origin and nowhere else, so anything same-origin
 * outside that prefix is an app asset and none of this guard's business. An
 * allowlist of `/@vite`, `/@id`, `/@fs`, `/node_modules/` would have to grow
 * every time the dev server invents a prefix; this does not.
 *
 * Cross-origin stays fully guarded, including a third-party host with `/api/`
 * somewhere in its path: the guard exists so no unexpected request reaches a
 * live API, and that is exactly one. Unknown cases therefore resolve to
 * GUARDED — the failure direction is a loud test, never a leaked request.
