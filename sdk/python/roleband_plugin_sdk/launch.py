"""How a plugin process starts: one command, for the host and for `FakeHost`.

The runner's interpreter is isolated (`-I`: no current directory, user
site-packages or PYTHON* variables on its path), which also ignores
PYTHONPATH, so its import path is the command's first argument: the SDK, then
the plugin's code, ahead of the venv's site-packages. It starts in `RUN_CWD`,
a directory no plugin can write, and inherits only `PASSED_ENV`. A plugin's
data directory comes in the `start` message, never as its working directory
nor on its path.
