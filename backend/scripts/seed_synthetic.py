"""Fill the database with a synthetic dataset, so a candidate build can be
validated without scraping anyone.

    python -m scripts.seed_synthetic              # seed (idempotent)
    python -m scripts.seed_synthetic --count 120
    python -m scripts.seed_synthetic --clear      # remove only its own rows

A candidate build is validated against a synthetic API dataset; this is it.
Without it, a fresh clone ends with "there are no jobs yet", and `setup.sh` points the new
contributor at `tracker.daily` -- a LIVE scrape of real employers' boards. In a
public repository that would be every new contributor pointing scrapers at real
job boards in order to look at a UI.

**What it reuses, and why that matters.** Synthetic `RawJob`s go through the real
enrichment (`annotate` + `build_enriched`) and the real persistence seam
(`persist_source`, the same function the pipeline's persist stage calls). Levels,
families, tracks, location groups and comp are therefore COMPUTED rather than
invented, canonical upserts and append-only observations behave exactly as they
do in production, and the ownership registry keeps its writers where they are
declared -- nothing new writes to `jobs`.

**What it deliberately does not do.**

* It registers no source. A synthetic adapter would need a `SOURCE_REVIEWS` row
  carrying a robots sha256 it cannot honestly supply, which is why
  `tests/example_adapter.py` is contained by location rather than registration.
* It resolves comp from `StaticCompProvider` alone, so it makes no network call.
  The pipeline's resolver would read stored and built-in rows first.
* It persists in `ScanMode.DISCOVERY`, which never closes a missing job, counts
  no miss and activates no binding. Fabricated rows must not be able to tell
  this system that a real requisition is gone, or that a binding reads its board.

**One thing it deliberately leaves alone.** The header's "Market data" badge
reads the SCHEDULER's last completed cycle (`ops.py`, `scheduler_status`), not
the run this script opens, so a seeded database still reads "no data yet". That
is true — no scan has run — and faking a scheduler cycle to silence a badge
would make the app lie about whether it has scraped anything. The Board, the
filters, comp and the detail views are all populated regardless.

**Safety.** Every requisition it writes carries the `SYNTH-` prefix, and it
refuses to write to a database holding any job without that prefix. The
longitudinal asset lives in one per-user cluster shared by every checkout
(`docs/development.md`), so a seeder that could not tell the two apart would be a data-loss
bug waiting to happen. It prints the cluster it resolved before it writes, and
`--clear` deletes by that prefix and nothing else.
