"""Optional Postgres harness for tests that must exercise real SQL.

Most of this suite is pure and needs no database. A few behaviours cannot be
tested honestly without one -- ON CONFLICT convergence, a DELETE that retracts
stale rows, a unique index doing its job. Faking a session for those would mean
mocking the subject under test, which the testing policy forbids, so they run
against real Postgres or they do not run at all.

Isolation: a THROWAWAY database (`_DB_NAME`, per process) is created on whatever
server the settings resolve to, and dropped at session end. It never touches the
`roleband` asset. If no server is reachable the fixture SKIPS rather than fails,
so the pure suite still runs on a machine with no database.

Scope: `pytest.ini` pins the asyncio loop to function scope, so every async
fixture here is function-scoped too and each test builds its own engine --
asyncpg connections are bound to the loop that opened them, and a session-scoped
engine handed across per-function loops fails in ways that look like flakes. The
expensive part (CREATE DATABASE + schema) still happens exactly once, guarded by
a module-level flag.
