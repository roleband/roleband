"""The synthetic seeder's safety properties, held to the code.

`scripts/seed_synthetic.py` exists so a candidate build can be validated without
scraping anyone. It writes to a cluster that is per-USER and
shared by every checkout (`docs/development.md`), so "it cannot touch a row it did not write"
is not a nicety here — it is the property that makes the script safe to ship at
all, and the one a public repository's contributors will lean on hardest.

Every claim here is checked by planting the break, not by inspection: disable
the guard and the first test fails; widen `--clear`'s filter and the third
fails; switch the persist call to `RECONCILE` and the last fails.
