"""Benefits come from our dataset or from one plugin, never both.

Contracts, each on the real dataset: the dataset reader answers from the dataset
alone and the plugin reader from the plugin's rows alone, so neither can shape
the other (no per-cell precedence between them); reading
a plugin never changes what the dataset reader answers after; an unknown cell is
never shown as "not offered"; a label no alias maps is kept under its own name;
every evidence record keeps the dataset's rules (a named company, a taxonomy
type, an id of its own), and nothing the runtime does writes it (every file
hash unchanged).
