"""The launchd scripts refuse to run off macOS, before they touch anything.

The macOS installer runs the supervisor as one launchd item, so `deploy/install.sh`
and `deploy/uninstall.sh` are macOS-only. Unguarded, off macOS they would run until
they hit `launchctl`, after creating `data/` and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, and,
for install, after `npm ci`, a pip install and a model download, leaving a
half-install and a `command not found` to explain it. They stop first and name
what does work on Linux.

Each script runs from a COPY in a scratch checkout, with `uname` stubbed and
every tool it would act through replaced by a recorder. That keeps a red run
safe: without the guard these scripts really do
bootstrap the supervisor and rebuild the dashboard.
