"""The route table and the response-model gate.

Three claims, kept apart because each is blind to the others:

1. **The table is frozen**. Every (method, path) the API exposes is recorded
   in the fixture, and no route may appear or vanish as a side effect. Regenerate the fixture ONLY for a deliberate route change:

       .venv/bin/python -m scripts.freeze_route_table

2. **A modelled route stays modelled, and coverage never falls**.
   Freezing the table says nothing about response SHAPES, so the fixture also
   records each route's declared model and a `modelled_count` that may only
   rise, except by the modelled routes a deliberate removal takes away.

3. **A route without a response model is a named exception, never a default**.
   Claim 2 cannot see a NEW route: add a `-> dict` handler,
   regenerate the fixture as claim 1 asks, and the count is unchanged, so every
   test above still passes. `NON_JSON_ROUTES` is the exact method/path inventory
   of the routes that answer no JSON of ours, each with its reason and each held
   to that reason; every other route must declare a Pydantic `response_model`,
   and one that does not fails here by name.
