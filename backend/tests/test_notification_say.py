"""`meta.say`: notifications as catalog keys the dashboard renders.

The keys are a contract with rows already stored, so they are frozen in
`tests/fixtures/notification_keys.json` (key -> parameter names). The
dashboard's half of the contract renders every sample from its catalog and
must reproduce the stored English (`notificationText.test.ts`); this half keeps
the samples current and complete.
