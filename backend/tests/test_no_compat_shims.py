"""Compatibility shims are prohibited, including ones absent from the name list.

A re-export left at a module's old path means two import paths for one thing,
and a newcomer copies whichever they find first. None exist under
`platform/`, `connectors/`, `taxonomy/`, `analytics/` or `workflows/`; this file
is what keeps it that way.

Two checks, because each is blind to the other's half. The retired names are
listed so a reintroduced one fails BY NAME. The structural rule catches a shim
nobody thought to list: a module under `tracker/` whose whole body is imports
is a re-export, unless it is one of the documented `python -m` entrypoints.

A third check guards the other end of the same rule. "One import
path per module" is only half of it: the path people actually type lives in a
docstring, and a module that moves tiers takes its documented command with it.
Unread, a stale `python -m` line is invisible until someone runs it. Every
command named in `tracker/` or `scripts/` source must resolve to a module that
can actually be run, and so must every command in a doc that describes the
current system: a stale command in a doc is worse than a stale docstring.
