"""Coverage notifications: a followed company not scanned in full lately.

What must hold, each a plausible way to get it wrong:

1. **The copy reports outcomes in the user's words** (`docs/copy.md`
   rule 6): when the company last had a full scan and what that costs
   (new roles may be missing), never binding / source / quarantine / sync.
2. **Only what a person loses.** An unfollowed company never rings; neither
   does a Workday company, scanned when its user asks, nor one
   followed yesterday that no scan has reached yet. A followed company rings
   after 3 days without a full scan; `lossy` counts as one; an empty careers
   page rings at once.
3. **One notice for an outage.** Five or more stale companies that are half or
   more of the automatically scanned ones ring once, not once each, and the
   per-company rows go; an empty board still rings on its own.
4. **Reconciled, not appended.** One row per company however many passes run;
   the row ages in place without losing its read or dismissed state; a full
   scan (or an unfollow) retracts it; other categories are never touched.
