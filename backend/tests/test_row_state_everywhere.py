"""A posting's reader state is the same on every surface that lists it.

Saved, Not for me, and how many twins a posting has are read for every job row
an answer carries, not only the Board's: a row that says "not saved" must have
been looked at. The lineage contract seed has a stack, twins and pairs in the
review queues; one posting is saved and one marked not for me, and each
surface that shows them must say so.
