"""A record we could not read is not a source we cannot trust.

A Workday listing can serve a few of its postings as stubs carrying only
`bulletFields`. Routing such a row through `invalidate_listing` says two things
at once — "absence is not closure evidence" AND "this source is broken". The
first is true of one bad row; the second is not. With `errors=[]` and no cap,
`classify_source_outcome` would read the incomplete-but-error-free listing as
`degraded`, and three of those quarantine a binding whose only exit is a fully
clean run.

These tests lock the split: `drop_record` keeps closure suppressed (the loss is
real) while keeping it *countable*, so proportionality is expressible one layer
up. The pipeline-level assertions matter as much as the unit ones — the rule
lives in the seam between the detector and the outcome derivation.
