"""Pure-logic tests for the pay-disclosure RATE and its daily snapshot grain (no DB).

The rate answers a different question from `build_posted_pay` and gets its
denominator from a different place, so the two things this suite exists to stop
are: (1) counting roles the extraction pass has not read yet as employer silence,
which would make the rate track our own backlog; (2) letting the basis rules that
govern band *values* leak into the rate, which is basis-independent.
