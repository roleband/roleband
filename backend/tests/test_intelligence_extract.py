"""extract_disclosed_comp pass — behavior against an injected fake session.

No DB, no model, and no provider either: the pass is deterministic
end to end. A FakeSession records adds/commits and returns the jobs we hand it
(SQL gating is covered separately in test_intelligence_gating).

What these pin: the pre-filter short-circuit, that a band is persisted only when
it is grounded in the FULL posting, that the derived pay basis beats whatever the
posting's wording suggests, that the pass never touches `content_changed_at`, and
that the core commits nothing: the pass loop and backfill own the commits.
