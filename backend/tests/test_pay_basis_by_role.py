"""A pay range the posting defines per kind of role.

Anthropic, Adobe, Databricks and Palo Alto Networks define their range as base
salary for non-sales roles and on-target earnings (or base + commission) for
sales roles. The text alone cannot say which applies, the role can. Contracts:

- Only an `unclear` band is settled; a marker the band's own text states wins.
- A non-sales role's band is base and a sales role's is total, as the employer
  defines them. Pre-sales, customer success, a customer-facing architect title
  and a row with no family stay unclear.
- A sentence about a bonus plan for non-sales roles is not a range definition.
- Every writer of a band (connector, text, page) applies the same rule, and
  reads a stated bonus target against the basis it settles on.
- A band its own paragraph calls a salary is base, outside a
  conditional clause, and never at Netflix, whose "salary" is a chosen share of
  a total. A posting that defines its band per kind of role is read by the role.
