"""`restore_db.sh` and `backup_db.sh`, run for real: what a drill proves, what it refuses.

The drill never reports "drill complete" after pg_restore fails, with `jobs`
empty, or with its row counts unreadable; `--check --into roleband` never
reaches the live database without asking; and the backup's own check reads more
than the archive's table of contents, so a dump cut off in its data is never
promoted as a good one.

Two layers:

* Decisions, with every PostgreSQL client stubbed: which database a set of
  flags names, what is refused before any database is touched, which outcome
  each restore result reaches, and that the drill and a live restore take the
  same path up to the swap. No server.
* The real thing, on a throwaway embedded cluster made for this module, never
  the shared one: the real backup script writes the archive, the real restore
  script restores it, and a dump cut off in its data, a dump with no postings
  and a dump missing a core table all fail. A restore that fails for any of
  those reasons leaves the live database as it was, because a live restore is
  verified beside it and swapped in, never written over it.

The scripts run from a copy of `deploy/` in a scratch root beside a
`backend/.venv/bin/python` that is either a stub answering `scripts.db_uri`
(decisions) or this interpreter running the real `scripts.db_uri` (real). In
the real layer the live database is whatever ROLEBAND_DATABASE_URL names on the
throwaway cluster, and HOME is the scratch root, so nothing can reach
`~/.roleband/db`.
