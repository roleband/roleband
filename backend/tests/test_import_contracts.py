"""The layer contract is enforced, complete, and shrinking.

`lint-imports` can report every contract kept while three holes sit underneath
that verdict:

1. **Membership is optional.** With `exhaustive = false`, a module named in no
   layer row is unconstrained: it may import anything and be imported by
   anything, and the report still says KEPT.
2. **The allowlist can grow.** `ignore_imports` is a ratchet ("shrink only,
   never add") in prose only. Adding a line to it is the easiest way to make a
   layering violation disappear.
3. **Nothing proves the rules fire.** A contract that names a module which
   moved, or a delimiter that means the opposite of what the comment claims,
   checks nothing and reports KEPT (the adapter list drifts the same way, see
   `test_import_contract_registry.py`).

The obvious fix -- `exhaustive = true` -- is not available. It requires
`containers`, which rewrites every layer name into tail form (`api` rather than
`tracker.api`), and `test_no_compat_shims.py::test_no_import_contract_names_a_retired_module`
matches retired names by their `tracker.`-prefixed spelling. Turning the flag on
would silently blind that gate. So membership is asserted here instead, where
the assertion is visible and the failure names the module.

The third check is the one that makes the other two worth anything. It builds a
skeleton package **from the live contract text** -- every module the contracts
name, and nothing else -- plants one import into it, and runs the real linter
over it in a subprocess. A contract that stopped constraining anything cannot
survive its planted edge. The L4 sibling case is the positive control: that row
is deliberately `:` (siblings MAY import), so it must pass, which is what
distinguishes "the rules fire" from "everything fails".
