"""SmartRecruiters: the board route, the walled API route, and the switch.

The contracts, each asserted on what a user would get wrong if it broke:

* **The board walk is complete or says it is not.** Every location group must
  list the postings it states; a group the more-route cannot complete, or fewer
  group pages than the board declared, invalidates the listing (closure
  withheld). Our own page ceiling is truncation, never blamed on the source.
* **The route follows the board.** A board that left SmartRecruiters moves the
  company to the API route; a board published again moves it back. The run
  that detects the move collects nothing (`unattempted`), carries the route
  out, and the pipeline records it: new adapter, old binding retired, a fresh
  binding with closure withheld.
* **The API route is walled.** An unconsented company sends nothing there, and
  a company that moved onto it is shown as walled (its consent dialog), not as
  an unwalled board.

Board fixtures are trimmed real pages (Roland Berger). API
fixtures follow SmartRecruiters' documented Posting API shape: the route is
robots-walled, and nothing was collected from it for this test.
