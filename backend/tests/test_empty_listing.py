"""A listing that served no postings, end to end.

Real collection, persistence, closure, health and scheduling against the
scratch database; only the board and the comp provider are stand-ins.

Two claims, kept apart because they fail in opposite directions:

1. **Zero rows never close anything**. Closure by absence on an empty listing
   is a separate contract that does not exist yet, so a listing that served
   nothing is never complete, whichever adapter read it. Otherwise an adapter
   that ends a zero-row listing without an empty guard keeps `list_complete`
   and a reconcile closes every open posting of the company.
2. **A board proven empty is a scan with no postings**, not a failure: no
   anomaly, no provider backoff, no catalog error, rechecked at the normal
   cadence. Read as failures, three of those quarantine the company and back
   off every company on its provider. It is still kept in view, because a
   moved board answers the same (Vercel). Every case has the unexplained zero
   beside it as the control, so a test that passed for both would be
   measuring nothing.
