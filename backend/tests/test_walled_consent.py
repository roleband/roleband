"""Walled companies are collected only with the user's consent.

Robots and bot walls gate on the user's consent, not on our refusal. The contracts, each asserted as an absence of requests where a
request is what would be wrong:

* A wall is read off the register row; its fingerprint names the evidence.
* `collection_access` refuses a walled company the user never consented to on
  every execution path — adapter entry, direct fetch, recipe adapter and runner,
  pipeline collection, smoke — and the user's consent unlocks exactly that.
* Consent is asked once per company: it stands when the robots file, the wall's
  kind or the fetch tier changes, and across an unfollow and a re-follow.
* Provider-level questions (no company named) answer the operator deny only.
* Following a walled company needs a consent in the request or a stored one;
  a walled company followed before consent existed stays followed and simply
  is not scanned.

Google is the real walled source (robots disallows its paginated listing), so
these tests use it; `google-deepmind` rides the same connector family.
