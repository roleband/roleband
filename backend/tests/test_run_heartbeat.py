"""Liveness heartbeat: the ticker that keeps a run's ``heartbeat_at`` fresh.

The ticker is exercised without a live database, against a fake
``session_scope`` recording its UPDATEs: what matters here is that it keeps
beating across a failed beat and stops on cancel.

What the beat MEANS is next door. ``reconcile_stale_runs`` answers to real
Postgres in ``test_stale_runs.py`` (a check on its SQL string would pass a
reconciler that stopped flipping rows), beside the one predicate it shares with
``/api/status``'s stuck count. The pure liveness decision that
consumes the heartbeat is ``is_run_active`` (``test_api_sync.py``, and held to
the SQL predicate row by row in ``test_stale_runs.py``).
