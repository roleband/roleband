"""Table-ownership completeness — the gate that keeps derived data automated.

A derived table whose only producer is a manual CLI stays empty on every
install that never runs it, unless something asserts that every table has an
automatic populator. This suite is that assertion:

* Every mapped table is claimed exactly once in `tracker/db/ownership.py`.
  Adding a model without a claim fails here, naming the table.
* Every `post_pass:<name>` claim names a real POST_PASSES entry, so a derived
  table can't claim a pass that doesn't run it.
* Every `manual:<route>` claim names a route in the frozen route table, so the
  refresh trigger can't silently vanish.

Each entry is a `TableOwnership`, so a claim arrives beside
the table's writers, read owner and lifecycle. Those three are held to the code
by `test_table_writers.py`; this file still owns the claim itself.

Never weaken this to land a table — declare its populator instead.
