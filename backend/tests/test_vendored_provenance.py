"""Vendored code must stay traceable to an upstream we can re-check.

RoleBand ships no scraper engine — the only upstream code here is a vendored
snapshot, updated by reviewed change and never by dependency automation. The
failure mode that policy creates is silence: a stale snapshot looks exactly like
a current one, so upstream fixes never arrive and nothing says so.

The registry is what makes staleness decidable, and these tests are what stop it
rotting: a recorded origin can name a module the vendored symbol never lived
in, and nothing catches it unless something executes the claim.

Live fetching belongs in `scripts.check_vendored_upstream`, never here
(`docs/testing.md`: tests do not fetch live sources). What is tested here is
the registry's completeness and the checker's verdict logic, against a mocked
transport.
