"""What a pipeline run leaves behind, however it ends.

Characterization of the pipeline along its seams: real scratch
Postgres, offline adapters, and a post-pass table cut down to the passes a case
needs. Nothing here replaces the pipeline itself. Four claims:

1. **A finished run releases what it took.** Whether it succeeds, loses its only
   source, or fails in a fatal post-pass: the advisory lock is free, the
   heartbeat task is finished, every adapter it opened is closed, the comp
   resolver is closed, and the run row carries a terminal status.
2. **A cancelled run releases its lock, heartbeat and collection, and writes no
   terminal status.** Every adapter it opened is closed and no `collect:` task
   outlives it. `CancelledError` is not an `Exception`, so the
   recovery block does not run; the committed marker stays `running` with its
   heartbeat stopped, which is exactly what the stale-run reconciler reads.
3. **Per-source commits survive a later failure.** A fatal post-pass after two
   sources persisted leaves both sources' jobs and source-run rows committed and
   records both on the failed run.
4. **The audit dicts keep their shape.** `scrape_runs.per_source[company]`,
   `scrape_source_runs.stats` and the summary `run_pipeline` returns carry exactly
   these keys and value types, per outcome, so a typed rewrite cannot rename,
   drop or retype a field that stored rows and readers already depend on.
