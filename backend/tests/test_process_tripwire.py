"""No test may start a process, kill one, or spend money.

`no_escape` (`conftest.py`) refuses every one of those. Two holes sit under
that:

1. **It is opt-in with nothing asking.** A suite that drives a spawning route
   and forgets the fixture runs the real thing: `POST /api/sync` launches a full
   scrape detached, `POST /api/sync/cancel` signals the process group of
   whatever sync the user has running, `PUT /api/intelligence/matching/tier`
   re-embeds the corpus, and a cloud client bills the account. The failure mode
   is not a red test -- it is a scrape the developer did not ask for.
2. **Nothing else proves the fixture refuses anything.** Without a test that
   asserts `EscapeRefused`, a patch target that moves (`httpx` internals, an
   `asyncio` spelling) would silently disarm the guard while every suite that
   "uses" it stays green.

So this file is the tripwire's own gate. It scans the suite for modules that can
reach an escape surface and requires each to carry the fixture for EVERY test in
it (module-level `pytestmark`, not one fixture that some tests happen to
request), and it asserts the refusals and the two deliberate carve-outs.

**The surface list is derived, not declared.** `SPAWNS` is checked against a live
scan of `tracker/` for the primitives, so a new `Popen` anywhere in the backend
fails this file until it is classified; `REACHING` is computed as the modules
that import one. Outbound HTTP is not itself a surface -- `platform.http` and
every connector make requests, tests mock the transport, and treating egress as
a surface would mark the whole suite. `cloud_llm.client` is named separately
because a real call there costs the user money.

Two criteria, because neither sees the other's case: a module that imports
the supervisor's runner need never make a request, and a module that posts to `/api/sync`
through `api_client` imports nothing at all.
