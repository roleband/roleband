"""The oMLX CLI a control call starts does not outlive the call.

`control()` kills and reaps its CLI on a timeout and on cancellation (the task
awaiting it cancelled); without the second the CLI keeps running. These tests run a
real, harmless child (a Python one-liner standing in for the CLI: the binary is
`sys.executable` and the spawn swaps the arguments), never oMLX, and kill
anything left over themselves.

Under `no_escape`, lifted for exactly two things: starting `sys.executable -c
<the test's script>`, and signalling the children this test started. Any
other spawn or signal is still refused.
