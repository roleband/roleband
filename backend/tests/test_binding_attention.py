"""The coverage report: followed companies not scanned in full lately.

What must hold, each a plausible way to get it wrong:

1. **Why is read from what the run recorded.** An errored run, or a page that
   answered an HTTP error status, was unreachable even when it scanned
   nothing; a page that answered and gave no rows was unreadable; a run that
   read some rows read part of the board; only the `empty` outcome is an empty
   page. The shapes come from the real adapters answering a mocked transport,
   not from hand-made dicts.
2. **A full scan is `ok`, `empty` or `lossy`.** The clock is the newest of
   those; the cause is the newest reconcile SINCE it that was none of them,
   and a deferral (`unattempted`) is no evidence either way.
3. **Stale is 3 days without a full scan**, counted from the binding's
   creation when there never was one: a company followed yesterday is not
   stale.
4. **Only followed companies, only their active binding**, never a retired
   one; an empty board is flagged however fresh.
5. **Counts cover every followed company even when the list is cut**, and an
   outage is five or more stale companies that are half or more of the ones
   scanned automatically.
6. **A board gone from its address leaves the status alone unless its provider
   is failing**: five or more of one provider's automatic boards, and half or
   more of them, answering "no such board". Companies moving their boards a
   few at a time across a large roster never add up to a provider failing.
