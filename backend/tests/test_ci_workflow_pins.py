"""Every workflow runs code it names exactly, with the least it needs.

A tag such as `actions/checkout@v4` or `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` can be moved
to other code by whoever controls it, and the next run executes that code
with the workflow's token. So an action is referenced by its full commit SHA
(the version it is, in a trailing comment, for the reader and for Dependabot),
a service image by digest, and every workflow declares its `permissions`
instead of inheriting the repository default. Every job also states its
`timeout-minutes`, so a hung step fails within minutes instead of the runner's
six-hour default.
