"""The ownership registry's writer, reader and lifecycle fields, held to the code.

`test_table_ownership.py` proves every table is CLAIMED. This proves the claim's
neighbours are true: that the declared writers are the writers, that a table
declaring no reader really has none, and that history is not being overwritten.

**Every check here is one-directional, and saying so is not a disclaimer — it is
the design.** `table_writers.py` resolves what it can (model classes, import
aliases, local bindings, rows loaded by `select`/`get` and then mutated) and
cannot follow a row handed back by a function: a helper that returns a row its
caller mutates makes that table scan as insert-only although it is updated
every run. A scan like that can prove a
declaration WRONG. It can never prove one complete, and a gate that claimed
otherwise would measure names, not behaviour. So:

* found writers must be a SUBSET of declared writers — an undeclared writer fails;
* `readers=()` must find no reader — a table claiming to be dead that is not fails;
* `lifecycle="append_only"` must find no update, delete or upsert;
* router writers must be exactly `ROUTER_WRITERS`, which may only shrink.

Never widen a declaration to make this pass without reading the write it names.
