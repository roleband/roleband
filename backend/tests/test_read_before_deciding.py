"""Read before deciding, and pay at every company that posts it.

A posting whose title states no level is not decided on its title alone: its
full posting often names the level (a stated range), so a posting that
fails the scope only on level is read first, and every company whose ranges
repeat reads a bare title by its range (`levels/pay_grades.PAY_BANDS`).
