"""Closure by absence needs two misses, against the real pipeline.

A posting closes only when two complete listings at least
`closure_second_miss_min_hours` apart have not listed it, with no failed,
degraded or blocked scan of its company between them. A posting a failed scan
hides is typically not listed in the very next complete scan either, so the
reset on a failed scan (rule 3) is the part that holds it open, not the second
miss.

Time is moved by `_age_absence`, which shifts every recorded first miss into
the past exactly as a day between scans would; nothing else is faked.
