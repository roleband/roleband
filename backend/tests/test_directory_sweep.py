"""The background scan of every other company RoleBand can scan.

What it may do, pinned from both sides:

* read the never-read first, most-linked first, then only what is a day old;
* follow a company exactly when a posting there passes the SAME gate the
  pipeline applies — and never one that has no such posting;
* record every read, including a failure, so a broken board is not retried in a
  loop and progress can be counted;
* never touch a company that already has a row: one followed by name, or one
  the user switched off, is theirs;
* do nothing at all while the set is not followed.

The job sites are a fake adapter; the scope gate, the store and the database
are real.
