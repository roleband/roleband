"""Family ladders and pay grades.

A company's title words mean different rungs in different families: Google's
"II" is L3 for an engineer, L4 for a program manager and L5 for a product
manager, and its "Senior" is L5 for an engineer and L6 for a product manager.
Rules are keyed by (company, family), the family is classified first, and the
company row is the fallback. Where a title names no rung, Google's posted
base range does: its ranges are per grade (`levels.pay_grades`).
