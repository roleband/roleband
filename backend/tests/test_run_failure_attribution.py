"""A failure is attributed to the thing that failed.

A run can collect every source cleanly — `list_complete`, `closure_eligible`,
binding still `healthy` — and then fail in a post-pass (the embedding pass
raising because a checkout has no model weights). The feed must not then say

    Scan finished with problems
    Problems at: all enabled sources.
    spotify | 71 | 13 | 9 | 0 | 4s | ok

two halves of one notification, disagreeing. Nor may the run's status become
`error`: `run_status_for` defines it as "no source produced usable data", and
`health.REFRESHED_STATUSES` excludes it on precisely that reading. A derivation
failing over healthy sources would freeze `last_success_at`, leave `stale` true,
and have `should_catch_up` kick another run into the same wall every hour.

These tests hold the three claims apart, because they fail differently.
