"""Closure safety under rebinding.

Closing by `company` + `seen_keys`, gated only on run quality (uncapped,
complete, no errors), is unsafe: a binding change produces a disjoint source-key set that still passes
every one of those gates -- so every open job would be closed and reopened as
new, destroying the longitudinal history the product exists to accumulate and
firing notifications on fabricated churn.

`decide_closure_scope` is pure, so these are direct behavior assertions rather
than mock-shaped ones.
