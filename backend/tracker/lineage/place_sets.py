"""Place sets: one role an employer lists once per place.

An employer may list one role as ten postings, one per city, each with the
same title and the same text. That is one role. It is not a repost lineage (nothing was listed again: the postings
run side by side) and not twins (nothing differs but the place), so neither
review queue has a right answer for it, and the lineage detector's
location gate rejects most such pairs before anyone sees them.

The rule is deterministic and asks nobody. Open postings of one company form a
place set when:

1. their `normalize_title` is equal (level words kept, so "Senior" never meets
   "Staff"; a trailing own-location suffix is stripped);
2. their description text is equal after folding whitespace and case, and is
   longer than `place_set_min_text_chars` (a stub is no identity evidence);
3. their `family` and `level_band` are equal;
4. EVERY member names a place (canonical cities when the posting has them,
   its raw strings otherwise). When every member states its OWN place (the
   board's primary location, `source_facts.locations[is_primary]`), members
   compare by that place alone: some boards print the posting's place first
   and the company's office list after it on every posting, so the lists
   coincide and only the primary tells the postings apart.

Two postings at the same place are the role listed again there. Whether that
is one opening or two is a headcount question text cannot answer, and the
person choosing where to apply does not need it answered: it is one role,
shown as a deck, each card saying what differs. The earliest posting at a
place, by the employer's own date, holds the place; each later one is
`relisted`, and still counts as a listing for the standing-posting sign. An
employer that lists all its cities on every posting and varies only the
primary one has the same places by the full lists and different ones by the
primaries. A group in which any member states no usable primary compares the
full lists.

A person outranks the rule twice over. A group containing any pair a person has
already decided (a lineage or twin verdict, either way) is left alone, and a
posting a person has called "Different roles" here joins no set until they take
it back.

Inside a set, a pending machine proposal between two members (a suspected
duplicate, a pending twin) is withdrawn, as re-detection withdraws a proposal
the current rules do not support. Human verdicts are never touched, and an
automatic lineage link (which counts toward a lineage while pending) cannot
join two members: a set's postings overlap in time, and only a closed posting
can be reposted.
