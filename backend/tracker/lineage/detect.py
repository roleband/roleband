"""Detection: fetch pgvector candidates, score them, persist lineage links.

Runs after ``embed_jobs`` in the pipeline (so freshly-inserted jobs already have an
embedding) and as the backfill workhorse. The scoring is pure (``score.py``); this
module is the DB half: the candidate query, the human-safe upsert, and the
projection rebuild.

``detect_lineage(adjudicator=...)`` lets a verifier adjudicate *suspected*
pairs. The deterministic rules remain authoritative.
