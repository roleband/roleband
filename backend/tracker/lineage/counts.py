"""Shared lineage-aware predicates for the counting/metric call sites.

One definition of "is this a NEW job vs a repost successor" and one definition of
the effective age clock, so demand, velocity, /api/stats, the board filter, and the
serializer all agree. A job is "new" when it is standalone or the original of its
lineage; it is a repost/duplicate when it is a later member. Aging accrues across
the lineage via coalesce(lineage_first_seen, first_seen).

    A place set is one role, so every count and the Board show it
    once, through its first member: the earliest `first_seen` (then id) among
    the members in the same status and scope as this one that pass
    `eligible`. A posting listed here is a set's later member; one in no set
    never is. The peer must share status and scope because the
    rebuild only runs between scans: a member that just closed, or one at a
    place out of scope, never hides the open, in-scope row the person can see.

    `eligible(peer)` returns the conditions a peer must meet to represent the
    set: the request's posting-level filters, built by the same function that
    filters the row (`db/queries/jobs.py::posting_conds`), so a filter selects
    the member that passes it instead of hiding the role behind an earlier
    member that fails it. None: every member is eligible, the
    unfiltered Board and every count.

    The later members are found once per statement, over the members alone:
    each set's members in one status and scope, eligible ones first, then by
    `first_seen` and id, so the first in that order is the earliest eligible
    member, and a member is later when that one came before it (by
    `first_seen`, then id), eligible or not. A member compared row by row
    with its peers lets the planner, on statistics that undercount the
