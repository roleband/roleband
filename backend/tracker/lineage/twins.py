"""Twin-opportunity detection and symmetric graph helpers.

Twins are separate openings. They never enter lineage projection or alter demand.
Human decisions are detector-immutable.

A proposal whose titles read the same, in one department, is matched
automatically: `confidence = 'auto'`, `status = 'pending'`, shown as
a related role at once (`TWIN_EFFECTIVE_SQL`) and listed under "Matched
automatically" for a person to check, as auto duplicate links are. Such
proposals are reliably right, and a wrong one costs a card in a deck, undone
with "Different roles". A near-title, a missing department or a title-grade
question stays a proposal.
