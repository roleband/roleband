"""The disclosed-salary-band extraction pass.

For each stale job with a monetary signal, scan the posting for a salary range,
validate it (grounding + bounds), and persist it into the `disclosed_*` columns —
alongside, never overwriting, the comp_* estimate. Gated exactly like embeddings
(`structured_at IS NULL OR content_changed_at > structured_at OR parser version changed`)
and slotted after the content-fingerprint step so `content_changed_at` is fresh.

The task's identity and the pure gating predicate stay in
`tracker/intelligence/extract.py`; what needs the store lives here.

WHY NO MODEL. Most stored bands never involve a model at all: connector parsers
read them straight out of the source payload. On the rest, `extract_grounded_band`
reproduces what a model answers, invents nothing on a no-band control set, and
never joins the low bound of one level band to the high bound of another, a
range printed nowhere in the posting, as a model can.

Salary extraction is core functionality, so it must work identically on every
machine with nothing installed and nothing configured. A deterministic scanner
does; a model that exists only on recent Apple silicon, or only after the user
installs a separate inference server, does not. Apple FM remains reachable from
Settings > Experimental for one-off testing, and the local/cloud tier ladder is
the model bench's; neither is consulted here.

Commits nothing: the post pass commits once per pass and the backfill command
commits each batch, so an interrupted backfill keeps every finished batch
(`extract_disclosed_comp`).
