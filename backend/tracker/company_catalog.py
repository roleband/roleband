"""Catalog of known companies a user can add from Settings.

Code-as-data (mirrors `config.COMPANIES`), and vocabulary like it: it imports
nothing, so the source register and the collection policy can read which
provider a catalog company is declared on (`source_review.declared_adapter`).
Every entry names its adapter and the board token we know for it, so adding
one needs no discovery step. The built-in companies in `config.COMPANIES` are
intentionally NOT duplicated here.

An entry is an OFFER, not a roster row: it makes `connector_state` report
`ready`, and nothing is fetched until a user adds the company. Adding rows is
therefore a data change, not a capacity change: the nightly roster does not
move by one request.

`board_region` is optional and means what it means on `TrackedCompany`: the
regional deployment of a multi-region ATS, ABSENT when the family has a single
host. Lever is the only such family here, and the key is not defaulted: "this
family has one deployment" and "this tenant is on the global host" are
different records, and a wrong region answers the same 404 as a wrong token, so
it can never be recovered from a failure.

**Board tokens rot, and a wrong one is not a safe failure.** A dead board
answers 404, not an empty board: the read is `failed` (`outcome.board_missing`)
on every scan and the company collects nothing until the token is fixed. A
token that resolves to another company's live board is worse, because no run
gate can tell. Re-check with `python -m scripts.check_catalog_tokens`, by hand,
on the same monthly cadence as `check_vendored_upstream`, since tests never
touch the live network. A token added here without running it is a guess.

**`curated` is a separate question from "ready".** A row with `"curated": True`
is on the curated list (the companies a user starts with and the ones "Include
other companies" does not touch); an absent key means it is not
(`company_discovery.is_curated`). A ready connector is an offer, never a
default follow.
