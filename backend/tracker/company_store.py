"""DB access for tracked companies (`tracked_company` table).

The table is the single source of truth for every company — built-in and
user-added alike. Built-ins are seeded from `config.COMPANIES` by
`ensure_builtins()` (idempotent) and then obey identical rules: the same
`enabled` (future scans) and `visible` (browse/aggregate display) columns, the
same API, the same pipeline targeting via `get_active_targets()`. The only thing
that marks a company built-in is `source="builtin"`, which blocks deletion.

    Pure and total, following `decide_closure_scope`: every branch
    that decides whether a company gains closure authority is testable on
    explicit inputs rather than through a session.

    Rules (top-down, first match wins):

    1. no `adapter` — not scrapeable, nothing to bind;
    2. already in `bound_slugs` — has a binding in ANY non-retired status.
       Deliberately not filtered to `stable`: a company mid-rebind sits at
       `reconciling`, and seeding a second `stable` binding underneath it would
       let two sources close the same company's jobs;
    3. `adapter` not in `known_adapters` — a stale row naming a connector that
       does not exist must never be handed closure authority;
    4. otherwise seed `stable`/**`none`** — collecting, not closing.

    Rule 4 withholds closure authority. Granting it at seeding would hand every
    newly onboarded company the right to close jobs by absence on the strength
    of a board token nobody had checked. A wrong-but-live token answers 200
    with a complete listing of somebody else's board, which passes every
    run-quality gate there is.

    The two knobs are deliberately split rather than both withheld:

    * `status` stays `stable`, because that is what the scheduler selects on
      (`scheduler._ensure_state`). A `shadow` row would never be reconciled, so
      it could never produce the evidence that activates it — the gate would be
      a deadlock, not a gate.
    * `closure_capability` is `none`, the model's own idiom for "may open and
      update jobs, never close by absence" (see `SourceBinding`). Authority is
      granted afterwards, from a run's evidence, by
      `db.binding.decide_binding_activation`.

    A row is still always emitted. Withholding must never become "no binding",
    which is a *widening*: `decide_closure_scope`'s no-row branch falls back to
    legacy company-scoped closure and closes everything.

    `activated_at` is left `None`: it means the binding was activated, which
    seeding is not.

    This function only ever emits `connector_kind` `adapter` — recipe bindings
    are created by `bind_recipe` and must still earn authority.
