    disclosure the employer withdrew.

    The groups in `_CARRIED_FORWARD` are the exceptions, because they are the
    groups we may not have ASKED for. The rule, per group: when this run did not
    request it, or asked and failed, and what we stored is one of that group's
    carried states, the stored group is kept whole with the timestamp of the
    observation that read it. When this run answered (present, or absent in a
    successful response), its answer wins. One rule, kept here alone: a
    failed optional detail request must not erase a confirmed disclosure, and a
    successful response that omits the field must not be papered over with a
    stale one. A listing scan never asks for the form or for the structured pay
    only the posting page states, so without this every scan would erase what
    the posting page told us, including that it states no pay.

    `_BIRTH_DATES` are the other exception: a date this run did not state is
    kept, because no source withdraws when a posting was published.
