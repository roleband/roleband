"""Company blueprint — the single declaration point for a tracked built-in.

One `CompanyBlueprint` entry per company declares its identity (slug, display,
adapter, public/ticker, brand color). Everything else derives:

- `config.COMPANIES` is generated from `BLUEPRINT`.
- `ensure_builtins()` seeds `tracked_company` rows from that.
- `profiles.seed.ensure_company_profiles()` materializes a `company_profile`
  row per tracked company and records the identity fields as `"blueprint"`
  claims (rank below a plugin, market data or a manual pin — any real source supersedes).

Coverage of the per-company tables that stay in their own modules (the
leveling model in `tracker/levels/`, price fixtures, dashboard branding) is
ENFORCED rather than consolidated: each surface registers a check in
`ARTIFACT_CHECKS`, and `tests/test_company_blueprint.py` runs every check for
every company. Adding a company = one `BLUEPRINT` entry; the test then names
every artifact left to fill. Adding a per-company feature = register one check
here in the same change.

Intentionally partial tables are NOT gated — do not add checks for them:
`PayPolicy.equity_vehicle`/`vesting` (exceptions only).

Location/office surfaces are jobs-derived (aggregated from open postings at
read time), deliberately not a declared per-company artifact — a declared
office list would rot, while the derived view stays current with each scrape.
