"""The supervisor's loop: settle what ended, stop what must stop, start what is due.

One `tick` is one look at the world. Order matters: ends are recorded before
anything starts, so a key whose run just ended is free in the same tick, and the
starts read the gate after the preflight that may have just proven the tree.

Every database step commits before the process step it allows: a claim is
committed before its spawn, so a supervisor that dies in between leaves a run
row that the next one settles (`adopt.reconcile`), never a process nobody knows.
