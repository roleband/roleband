"""Bounded log files that a child writes to directly.

A supervised child is detached: it outlives a supervisor restart. So it never
writes through a pipe to the supervisor, whose death would end it with SIGPIPE.
It writes to a file opened for append, and the supervisor rotates that file by
copying it aside and truncating it; the child's appends continue at the new end.
The few lines written between the copy and the truncate are lost, which is the
price of rotating a file another process holds open.
