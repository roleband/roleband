"""What a killed test suite leaves behind, and its removal.

    python -m tracker.supervisor.residue <basetemp>

Killing a suite's process group does not end everything it started. A test's
throwaway cluster is started by `pg_ctl`, which detaches the server into a
session of its own, so it outlives the group; and each worker's scratch database
`roleband_test_<pid>` stays in the configured server, because only the worker's
own session end drops it.

The preflight runs its suite with a temp root of its own (`--basetemp`), so every
cluster under that root is the preflight's to stop, whoever else is testing on
this machine. A scratch database is dropped only when the process its name
carries is gone: a suite still running elsewhere keeps its own.

Cleaning up never starts a database. An embedded cluster that is down holds no
scratch database, and the default folder can be the installed app's: a server
started there from a checkout keeps the app from starting its own engine.
