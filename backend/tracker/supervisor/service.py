"""The supervisor as a long-running service: hold the lock, adopt, then loop.

It wakes the moment a request or a cancel is committed (LISTEN on the store's
channel) and otherwise every `idle_seconds`, or every `busy_seconds` while a job
runs, so an end is recorded promptly. The poll never depends on the listener:
a dropped listening connection only delays a start until the next full look,
and is reopened.

A full look (`Dispatcher.tick`) reads the machine, plans, starts and publishes.
A busy turn that only timed out records what ended and begins the stops that
are due (`Dispatcher.settle`), and follows with a full look only when a run
ended or a stop began. A notification, a sleep, a change in what the supervisor
publishes beside the plan, and `idle_seconds` since the last full look each
make the next look a full one.

A stop (SIGTERM from launchd) ends the loop and leaves running jobs running:
they are their own sessions, and the next supervisor adopts them. Maintenance
(`maintenance.py`) is the other way out of the loop: the running jobs are stopped
or waited for, every connection is let go, and the supervisor waits, touching
nothing, until it is lifted.
