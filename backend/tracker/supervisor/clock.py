"""Two clocks: awake time for timeouts, and the gap that says the machine slept.

A laptop with its lid shut is asleep for hours. A timeout counted in wall-clock
time would end a healthy scan the moment the lid opens, so timeouts count awake
time: `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW` on macOS, which stops while the machine sleeps, and
`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on Linux and unbiased interrupt time on Windows. Named
explicitly rather than through `time.monotonic()`, whose source an interpreter
may change.
