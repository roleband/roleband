"""Per-source collection review: classification, decision, and the evidence.

A source-by-source register of access method, robots status, terms, request
identity, fetch tier, review decision, review date and reviewer. It **enforces
nothing**: `source_policy.collection_access` remains the only thing that can
refuse a request, and a second refusal path would be a competing policy
system.

Three separate questions, deliberately not collapsed:

* **access classification** — how we reach the source (A-E). A documented
  public API is not the same claim as an undocumented careers endpoint, and
  neither is a permission.
* **review decision** — whether a human has reviewed this source and what they
  concluded. `UNREVIEWED` is the honest default and is **not** approval:
  "Unknown review status is not evidence of approval."
* **closure capability** — whether the binding may close jobs by absence. Lives
  on `SourceBinding` and is not repeated here. A permitted source may
  still lack closure authority, and an approved one is not thereby validated.

Why code-as-data rather than a table: a review decision is a dated, cited,
reviewable record, as provenance is in `tracker/vendored.py`; provenance in
prose rots unverified. In version control a decision arrives with a diff and
an author. `scripts.check_source_review` re-measures the robots
evidence against what is recorded here, so a stale entry is detectable rather
than merely old.

**Provider approval is not tenant approval.** `effective_review` requires BOTH
levels, which is how the rule "do not approve one employer by approving its
whole ATS" is expressed rather than commented. An ATS's terms permitting
anonymous board reads say nothing about whether a particular employer's board
is one we may collect.
