"""Backfill content fingerprints + embeddings over the existing corpus.

Run after a deploy or any bulk text change to (re)compute `content_changed_at` and
semantic embeddings for jobs the daily pipeline hasn't touched:

    python -m tracker.semantic.backfill              # all jobs
    python -m tracker.semantic.backfill --open       # only currently-open jobs
    python -m tracker.semantic.backfill --refresh    # force re-embed all
    python -m tracker.semantic.backfill --provision --refresh   # after a tier switch

Incremental by default: fingerprints only bump on text change, and embeddings only
re-run when `content_changed_at > embedded_at`. Skill requirements have their own
backfill (`python -m tracker.skills.backfill`).

`--provision` downloads the artifact the current tier needs before embedding —
this is the entry point a tier switch spawns, and after a switch the
required artifact is by definition not on disk yet. `--refresh` there is not
optional: fp32 and int8 are the same model in *nearly* the same space, so a
corpus half in each is a mixed space, not a slightly worse one.

Interruption is safe by construction. `--refresh` clears `embedded_at` but
leaves `jobs.embedding` in place, so the board keeps ranking on the old vectors
while new ones land — degraded, never blank — and the nightly pipeline embed
pass already picks up anything with `embedded_at IS NULL`, so an abandoned
switch finishes itself rather than stranding the corpus.
