"""Compensation resolver: aggregates providers into one range with provenance.

The pipeline passes its providers: the stored per-level rows first
(`comp_providers.table`), then the static seed, then (when switched on) the
built-in dataset's base (`enrich.builtin_pay`). With none given
the resolver uses the seed alone, which needs no database and no network. The
resolver never fails a posting: if nothing resolves, comp fields stay None and
the job is still tracked.

`EstimateSet` holds two resolvers side by side: OURS, built from our
data only, and the selected plugin's, built from its rows only. Every posting
is estimated by both; neither reads the other's providers, so a plugin never
fills a gap in ours and ours never fills one in a plugin's.
