"""Job-seeker-facing company discovery catalog.

``company_catalog`` answers an implementation question: which
boards can be enabled immediately? This module answers the product question:
where might a job seeker want to look? Company identity is canonical and sector
membership is many-to-many, so selecting Microsoft in Gaming and Technology
still creates one tracking target.
