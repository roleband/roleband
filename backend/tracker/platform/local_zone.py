"""This machine's time zone: the one answer every local calendar reads.

"Today" for the statistics and the Board, the digest's days, a notification's
day label, the schedule plan's days of the week and ready-by time, and the
supervisor's daily slots are all wall-clock facts in the user's zone, so they
all read it here. It is a zone with its daylight-saving rules, never the fixed
offset of the moment: an offset taken today is wrong for a date across a change.
The dashboard sends its zone with every schedule plan change and the plan
stores it; this answers for a plan nobody has edited yet. Imports no other
tracker module.
