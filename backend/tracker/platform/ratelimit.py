"""Async min-delay rate limiting, shareable per backend scope.

Within a process, `RateLimiterPool` gives every consumer of one backend scope
one pacer. Across processes it cannot: the scheduler (and the manual sync it
also runs), the directory pass and role discovery each build their own pool, and
the directory reads Greenhouse, Workable, Ashby, SmartRecruiters and Lever under
the very scope names the scheduler paces. Two pools would mean up to twice a
host's allowance whenever both ran.

`enable_shared_pacing(directory)` closes that: every pool built afterwards in
the process reserves its slots in one small file per scope, so the per-scope
`min_delay` is the COMBINED bound for every process that enabled it. Only the
provider-facing entrypoints enable it; tests and ad-hoc scripts stay
process-local and never touch the live pacing state.

A reservation holds the file lock for a read and a write, never for the wait,
so neither process blocks behind the other's work: requests interleave at the
shared rate, first come first served. A manual sync started during a directory
pass therefore shares the host's allowance with it rather than waiting for the
pass to end.
