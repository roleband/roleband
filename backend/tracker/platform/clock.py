"""Progress-based source liveness: a sliding stall bound plus a hard ceiling.

The problem this closes: a fixed per-source time budget cannot tell *slow but
working* from *hung*. A board that legitimately needs 1300s and a source that
returns nothing at all both hit a 300s cap, so the cap truncates healthy sources
every run while a genuine hang survives to the end of its allowance.

A source is alive while it makes progress. `SourceClock` holds two bounds:

    stall    sliding  — pushed forward by `progress()`; expiry means silence
    ceiling  fixed    — never moves; expiry means "we stopped it", not "it broke"

That distinction is the point. Silence is a source pathology and must count
against the source (a `degraded` run resets every posting's absence count);
hitting *our* ceiling while still producing is our own
threshold talking, and must not. `at` collapses both to the single monotonic
timestamp every existing deadline consult-point already reads, so the bound
threads through the transports unchanged.

Two rules callers must honor, or the stall bound misreads healthy work:

* **Deliberate waits are not silence.** Time we chose to spend — rate-limiter
  pacing, retry backoff — must be followed by `progress()`. Otherwise a source
  politely obeying `Retry-After` is judged dead for good behavior.
* **Only completed work counts.** A response received or an item yielded is
  progress; *issuing* a request is not. Otherwise a source failing every
  request forever never looks stalled.

`clock` is injectable so tests need no patched module globals, matching the
"pass the bound in, keep the decision pure" style used by the outcome and
closure-scope helpers.

L0 by construction: this module imports nothing from `tracker`, so the
import-linter layer contract holds and any transport may depend on it.

    sleep, a hypervisor pause, a SIGSTOP — but the wall clock does. The gap
    between the two elapsed times is therefore time during which this process
    was not running at all, and neither was the network stack it had sockets on.

    Why this needs measuring rather than assuming: a suspension does not raise,
    it lands as a *transport error on the far side of it*. Every connection open
    across the gap is dead on resume, so the first read after wake returns EOF
    and surfaces as `httpx.ReadError` with an empty message — indistinguishable,
    at the call site, from the source having broken. Runs that record such a
    `ReadError` sit on gaps of minutes and clean runs on gaps of seconds, so the
    gap is what separates "our laptop slept" from "the source is unwell".

    Portable by construction: CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Linux and `mach_absolute_time`
    on macOS both exclude suspend, so the same subtraction reads the same thing.

    The one false positive is a wall-clock *step* (an NTP correction large
    enough to clear the threshold). That is rare, and it is deliberately the
    safe direction to be wrong in: a false suspension costs one run of
