"""Cross-process mutual exclusion: a file lock (``filelock``) + Postgres
advisory-lock helpers.

The file lock is the primary guard against two pipeline runs overlapping (a
scheduled run racing a watchdog catch-up, or a manual CLI). The OS releases it
automatically when the holding process dies, so a crashed or hung run never
leaves a stale lock behind — no timestamp/pid cleanup needed.

The advisory helpers provide session-scoped run exclusion and
transaction-scoped read-modify-write serialization across processes sharing
one database.
