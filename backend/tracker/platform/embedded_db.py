"""Embedded Postgres lifecycle: start or attach a server for a PGDATA directory.

L0 primitive. It takes a path and returns a live server; *which* path (and so
which database) is policy that lives in `config.py`.

Provenance: `pixeltable-pgserver` 0.7.2 — fork of `orm011/pgserver`, PostgreSQL
License + Apache-2.0. The wheel ships PG 16.15 (`pginstall/`) and 18.6
(`pginstall18/`), pgvector 0.8.7 in both, and the full client toolchain
(`initdb`, `pg_ctl`, `psql`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `pg_upgrade`). Measured
from the wheel; re-measure on a version bump — `VERIFIED_UPSTREAM_VERSIONS` makes that
mandatory rather than aspirational: an unverified wheel version is refused at
the import seam instead of silently running on unmeasured behaviour.

Upstream behaviours this module compensates for:

* **The socket directory is not caller-selectable.** `find_suitable_socket_dir`
  uses PGDATA when the path fits the ~104-char unix-socket cap and a hashed
  directory under the user runtime path otherwise. So never hardcode a socket
  path: `postmaster.pid` is the only authority, and `uri()` reads it.
* **initdb inherits locale from the environment** — upstream passes no
  `--locale`, so an unpinned first run bakes host-dependent collation into the
  cluster permanently, changing every text ORDER BY. Pinned here at initdb
  time, the only moment it can be chosen.
* **A SIGKILLed holder leaks its PID** into `<pgdata>/.handle_pids.json`, and
  upstream stops the server only when that list drains to the caller's own PID.
  One leaked entry disables shutdown for the cluster's lifetime, so
  `_prune_dead_holders` sweeps it before attaching.
* **The wheel ships no contrib modules** — setup installs a matching prebuilt
  `pg_trgm` alongside it. `require_extensions` asserts availability with
  remediation text rather than letting a migration fail halfway.
* **The socket option is unquoted, and the start takes no server settings.**
  Outside Windows every start goes through a quoted pg_ctl option string,
  which also carries the caller's `server_settings`, before upstream attaches.
  Upstream's own start then never runs, so neither does its clearing of a
  lock file left by a crash: `_clear_stale_lock` repeats it before our start.
* **Windows trust authentication exposes the cluster to other accounts.**
  The native adapter owns initialization, account-private credentials, SCRAM,
  runtime settings and process/endpoint validation before any connection.
