"""The embedded database's memory presets, picked from the computer's memory.

Postgres's stock sizes suit a small shared server. A person's computer gives the
database more memory and an SSD, and a scan sorts and rewrites far more than the
stock sizes hold. Each start selects a preset through `embedded_db.ensure_server`.
POSIX passes it on the server command line. Windows regenerates a runtime include
file before starting. A start without a preset returns the stock values.

Each preset also names itself and the memory it was picked from as `roleband.*`
settings, so the running server reports which preset it started with:
`SHOW roleband.preset`.
