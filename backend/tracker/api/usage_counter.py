"""Counts each successful mutation by its stable action name (docs/architecture.md).

A raw ASGI middleware, mounted inside `LoopbackBoundary` (so a refused request
is never counted) and around the router. After the response it reads the route
the router matched (`scope["route"].path`, the TEMPLATE, `/api/jobs/{job_id}/
favorite`, never the requested path with its ids) and the status it answered,
and a 2xx adds one to that route's action in the in-process tally
(`usage_stats.tally`). Nothing is written in the request: the tally is drained
to the outbox every minute, and only while the user shares usage.

An unhandled exception in any request, a read included, is scrubbed into the
tally (only while crash reports are shared) and re-raised untouched, so the
response is the 500 it always was. Only unsafe methods are counted as actions.

Every unsafe route is either in `ACTIONS` or in `NOT_COUNTED` with its reason;
`tests/test_usage_counter.py` fails a route that is in neither, so a new
endpoint is a decision, not a silent gap.
