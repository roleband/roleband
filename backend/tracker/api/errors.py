"""Errors the API answers with a code, not prose (docs/copy.md).

The dashboard says every error in the reader's language from its catalog
(`dashboard/src/copy/en/errors.ftl`, one `error-<code>` message per code), so
a router never sends English for a person to read. It raises

    raise api_error(404, ErrorCode.JOB_NOT_FOUND, "job not found")

which answers `{"detail": {"code": "job-not-found", "params": {}, "message": "job not found"}}`.
`message` is English for logs and the MCP server; `params` carries what a
message needs (slugs, never display names: the client names them). The codes
reach the dashboard through `openapi.json` (`ErrorDetail`), where a test fails
on a code with no catalog message.
