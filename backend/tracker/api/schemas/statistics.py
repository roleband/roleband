"""Response contracts for the statistics and demand routes.

`GET /api/stats`, the Statistics overview, compensation, stock trajectory, equity
validation, the comp and disclosure trends, the level guide, and `/api/demand`. The velocity route
declares its own models beside its handler.

- **Every shape here is one our code builds**, so every model forbids unknown
  keys, declared in the order the builders write them. A row that names its
  group before its figures (`{"company": ..., **summary}`) is built from a key
  mixin listed LAST among the bases: Pydantic collects the last base's fields
  first.
- **Numbers keep the type the builders give them.** Percentiles are linear
  interpolations and always floats, even over one value; counts, dollars and
  histogram edges are integers; shares and rates are rounded floats.
- **Literals where our code owns the vocabulary**: the trend dimensions each
  handler accepts, the split and bonus sources `analytics.comp_split` and
  `comp_residual` name, the pooled disclosure basis, and the `USD` the payloads
  state. Companies, level bands and families stay `str`: they are database strings.
- One key set per route, so no unions. A disclosure-trend point for a day a
  series has no cell is assembled with `date` last, and arrives with `date`
  first like every other point.
