"""Response contracts for the operational surface.

Health, the freshness/supervision status the watchdog and the header badge
poll, the run log, the manual sync trigger, picker and cancel, and the
connector schedule Settings reads and moves.

Every shape here except two JSONB columns is built by our code, so every model
forbids unknown keys: a key the serializer adds without its model is a 500 a
test catches, never output that silently fails to arrive.

**A shape whose keys differ by branch is a union, never optional keys.** Five
serializers return different key SETS depending on what happened: a disabled
post-pass carries no freshness fields, only a stale binding names its last
reconcile, a started sync reports what it queued while an attached one names
the run, and a cancel that stopped nothing names no run. Each branch is its own
model and the field or route answers their union, so "this key is absent here"
is a type a client narrows on, not a `null` it has to guess about. Where a
string literal tells the branches apart (`status`, `reason`) the union is
discriminated on it. A route that answers a union answers a named `RootModel`
of it, which serializes as the branch itself and is what the route table
counts as modelled.

Literal types only for vocabularies our code owns: the scheduler's provider
states and overdue reasons, the sync and cancel statuses, and `SourceOutcome`,
which `/api/sync/targets` derives at request time. Strings read back from the
database stay `str`: no CHECK constraint bounds a run status, a derivation
status or a stored provider outcome, and a historical row
keeps whatever its writer wrote.

`per_source` and `drift_alerts` are served exactly as stored. A typed model would
re-emit their keys in its own declaration order instead of JSONB's, and the
stored key set is pinned where it is written (`tests/test_pipeline_lifecycle.py`).

Fields are declared in the order the handlers build them, so every response
keeps its key order byte for byte.
