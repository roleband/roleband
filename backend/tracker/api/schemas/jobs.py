"""Response contracts for the job browse surface: list, detail, view, favorite, dismiss,
similar postings and filter facets.

Each model states what its route serializes, key for key and in the order the
serializer writes it. Two rules decide how strict a model is.

- **A shape our code builds forbids unknown keys** (`extra="forbid"`). A Pydantic
  response model filters out whatever it does not declare, so a lenient model
  would turn a key added to a serializer into output that silently never
  arrives. Forbidden, the same drift is a 500 that a test catches.
- **A shape read from JSONB allows unknown keys and keeps them**
  (`description_sections`, `comp_sources`). The database is the writer there, and
  a row written by an older version must still render.

Literal types appear only where the value is a constant in the code building the
response, or a database CHECK constraint enforces it; `test_api_job_contract.py`
holds each vocabulary to its source. Database strings with no constraint (skill
facets, importance bands, modalities) stay `str`: an unexpected value is a
display question for the client, never a reason for the API to fail.

Keys present on only some responses of a route (the relevance envelope's
`parsed`, an intent row's `why_world`) default to None, and those routes use
`response_model_exclude_unset=True`, so a key the handler did not set stays
absent instead of arriving as `null`. `SkipJsonSchema[None]` marks a key that is
either absent or a real value, never `null`.
