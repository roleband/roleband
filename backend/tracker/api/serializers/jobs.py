"""One posting, as every job surface sends it.

Five routers answer with the same posting shape. A read that more than one
surface builds from is not a route helper, so the serializer lives here rather
than in one router.

It stays under `tracker.api` because a wire shape is transport: the keys, the
`detail` split and the reader-state arguments are what `api/schemas/jobs.py`
declares, and nothing below the API layer should know them.
