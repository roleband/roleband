"""What every scope save does after it re-projects `in_scope`.

A save that can widen the scope promotes the postings a sync already read
(`scope.promotion.promote_on_save`) and queues a sync of the companies it
admitted from, so their descriptions, pay and derivations follow within one
scheduler tick. Queued, not started: the always-on dispatcher collects due
work, and a save that spawned processes would reach every test that drives
it. A company read only at its user's direction is left to them
(`scheduler.queue_promoted_reconciliation`).
Promotion runs before the save's commit, the queue after it; neither can
fail the save.
