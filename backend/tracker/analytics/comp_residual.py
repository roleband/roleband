"""Validate the modeled equity slice against employer-stated base bands.

`Job.comp_median` is a level-seeded TOTAL-comp estimate whose equity slice is
always modeled (`comp_split`: heuristic band shares, overridden by observed
`company_comp_level.stock_pct`). Employer-stated base bands
(`disclosed_base_min/max`, basis='base', often with a stated bonus share) are
ground truth for CASH. The difference is therefore an *implied equity* figure:

    implied_equity = comp_median - stated_base * (1 + bonus_share)

Aggregated per (company, band), the implied range can be compared against the
modeled equity share. This is a consistency check on the model, emphatically NOT
an "estimate error" metric — the gap between the estimate and a stated base band
is equity by construction. Vocabulary in the output sticks
to `implied_*`, `residual_vs_model`, `consistent`.

Pure and DB-free: the API/report layer runs the SQL and injects rows, mirroring
`comp_stats.build_posted_pay`.

    (company, band, seed, base range) tuple, so duplicates collapse with a `reqs`
    count. Uncertainty is carried as a RANGE by propagating base_min..base_max
    (and the envelope across a group's distinct tuples) — no point estimate is
    pretended. Negative implied equity is reported as-is: it means the seeded
    estimate does not even cover stated cash there, which is signal.
