"""Compensation-trend rollup engine.

Mirrors `demand.compute_demand_metrics` / `skills.analytics.compute_skill_demand`
for the comp layer: once per pipeline run it snapshots comp percentiles over
currently-open roles at four grains (overall + per company / level / family) and
upserts one dated slice per grouping into `comp_metrics`. This is the longitudinal
series the Statistics "Compensation" trend reads. The percentile math is the pure,
DB-free `comp_stats.build_comp_metric_rows`; this module only does the SQL + upsert.

The same shape is repeated for pay *transparency* (`disclosure_snapshot`): what
employers literally published, versus the imputed estimate the comp tables track.

    Two aggregations with different scopes, which is the whole reason the snapshot
    keeps `pay_basis` on the row:

    * **rate** sums every basis (including `''`, the roles that stated nothing),
      because "did the employer publish anything?" does not care what they
      published. Recomputed from counts rather than stored, so hiding a company
      removes it exactly from every historical point.
    * **band medians** pool only rows whose `pay_basis == basis`. One vote per
      *distinct* band, not per req: an employer hangs many reqs off one published
      band, so req-weighting would report which band is most reposted
      rather than what employers publish. `reqs` is carried alongside so the UI
      can still say how many open roles ride on those bands.

    The market line moves when the company set does: companies added
    mid-window may state pay more or less often than the first set, so the
    all-companies rate can move while the original companies' does not. For `overall`, when a company was read on a
    later day that was not on the first, a second series keyed `cohort` follows
