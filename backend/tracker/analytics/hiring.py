"""Where the Hiring tab says roles are open. Pure, DB-free.

A `demand_metrics` slice counts a POSTING once per location group. Groups nest
(a London posting is london, uk and europe) and a place that names only a
region expands to every country in it ("Remote EMEA" is every EMEA country), so
summed slices multiply each posting many times over. This counts ROLES, each
once per region and once per country it names.

Two kinds of place, read per place the posting lists (`listed_places`):

* A place that names a country, or a city or metro in one ("London, UK",
  "Munich"), puts the role in that country and its region.
* A place that names only a region ("Remote - EMEA", "Americas") puts the role
  in the region as *region-wide*, never in each country. The Board's place
  filter admits such a role in every country (a person tracking Germany should
  see a remote-EMEA role); a count by country must not multiply it.

A place set is one role: the caller passes the union of its
members' places as one role. A role whose places name nothing we can place
("Remote", "Anywhere") is counted as unplaced, never dropped.
