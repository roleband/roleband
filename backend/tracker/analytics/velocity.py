"""Hiring-velocity analytics for the Statistics "Velocity" sub-tab.

Pure, DB-free assembly of pipeline-motion signals over a time window: how many
roles opened and closed, the aging distribution of still-open roles, and how long the postings that disappeared had been observed.
Unlike the other analytics sub-tabs this one is inherently period-scoped, so it
honors the shared period lens. The API layer runs the SQL (event counts, ages in
days, observed durations) and hands primitives here so all the shaping is
unit-testable.

**This is not time-to-fill, and never was.** The sample is
`closed_at - first_seen`: from the first observation in a posting's lineage to
the reconciliation that found it gone. RoleBand sees a public board, so it can
say a posting stopped being advertised and cannot say a person was hired —
employers legitimately unpublish, pause, re-post and schedule expiry, and a
posting can also vanish because our own scan of that board changed. A name like
"time to fill" would assert an employer outcome from an availability
observation, so the measure is `median_observed_listing_duration_days`.

Young-data note: the duration needs closed roles with a spread of values, and
the aging bands only spread as history accrues — the UI flags this.

    `event_rows`: `(company, event_type, count)` for the window: roles first
        seen in it, and lifecycle events in it. `opened` counts only
        genuinely-new roles; a repost/duplicate re-listing arrives as a
        synthetic `reposted` type, so it never inflates opened. A role a
        company's first read found arrives as `first_scan`: the board was
        already listing it, so it is counted apart and never in opened.
    `duration_rows`: `(company, observed_days)` for roles that closed in the window
        (one sample per lineage — only a terminal, fully-closed member contributes).
        Observed availability, not a hire: see the module docstring.

        of each sample the employer also dated.
