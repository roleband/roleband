"""The compensation package shown on a job: cash, bonus, equity — and how sure we are.

Two independent things about a role's pay, which the UI must never conflate:

  WHAT KIND of money it is   -> base / bonus / equity
  HOW SURE we are of it      -> stated by the employer, or estimated by us

A trustworthy `disclosed_pay_basis` is what makes this module possible. When the posting states a band AND we know that band is base salary, the base
figure is a HARD FACT. We anchor the package on it and scale only bonus and equity off
the company's measured base->bonus/equity ratios, so the one number we are certain of is
the one everything else is derived from.

When the employer states a figure but never says what it means (`unclear`), we do NOT
decompose it. Splitting a number whose
meaning the employer withheld would invent a fact the employer never stated. We
show it as-is beside the estimate and say the basis is unstated. Netflix is distinct:
its range is total compensation, but each employee elects the salary/stock-option mix,
so the total is stated while its component split is not.

Pure: no DB access. The API injects `baselines`, mirroring `comp_split.py`.
