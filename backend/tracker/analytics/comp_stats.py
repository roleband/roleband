"""Compensation analytics for the Statistics "Compensation" sub-tab.

Pure, DB-free aggregation over the estimated compensation on open jobs: overall
percentile summary, a distribution histogram, and per-level / per-company /
per-family breakdowns. The API layer fetches `(company, level_band, family,

testable without a database. Comp is an *estimate* (see `Job.comp_provenance`);
