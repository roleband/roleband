"""Overdue follow-ups on active pursuits (`pursuits.next_action_due`).

The one notification whose absence costs the user an opportunity: a follow-up
they owe and forgot.

Reconciled, not appended. Each pass rewrites the set of open `pursuit_due` rows
to match reality: overdue pursuits get a row, pursuits that are not overdue any
more (actioned, rescheduled, or advanced to a terminal stage) lose theirs. That is
what makes it safe to run on every scrape -- the alternative, insert-and-dedupe,
would leave a stale "3d overdue" row standing after the user had already done the
thing, and an alert that outlives its cause is worse than no alert.
