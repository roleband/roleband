    `unreached`: a stored run's deadline came before the company started. Only
    `deferred_reason` says that (the marker `run_persistence` reads too):
    `unattempted` alone also covers a policy refusal and an adapter this build
    lacks, and neither is a timeout.
    A deferred company also carries the run-deadline marker in `errors`, so
    reading `errors` alone would name it both as a problem and as not reached
    in one notification.

    `cut_short`: our own time ceiling stopped a listing still producing
    (`bounded`). A retry pass takes it again and its learned budget grows, so
    it is this run's news.

    `quiet`: ours, and never a run's news, because it is the same every run.
    A policy refusal is a standing decision (the operator's deny list, a wall
    awaiting consent), reported where it is decided: the schedule's
    `policy_denied`, the Companies row's "Needs consent". A fetch tier this
    build lacks refuses the same way and is named only in the run's own
    per-source record (`policy_reason`, served by the run log). A page ceiling
    (`truncated`) is deterministic (outcome.py leaves it out of `RETRYABLE`),
    so a board past it would read "only in part" on every run, promising a
    complete read that never comes; the Companies row says "partly counted".

    An adapter this build lacks is none of these: it records an error and
    stays a problem.

    `offline`: no job site accepted a connection when the company's read
    failed, or when its lane reached it. Our network, not the
    company, so it is named with what happens next, never as a problem.
