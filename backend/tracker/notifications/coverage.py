"""A followed company RoleBand has not scanned in full for days.

`/api/status.bindings_attention` reports every followed company without a
recent full scan; this rings for the ones a person loses something to:

- **Scanned automatically.** A user-directed company whose user chose to have
  it read only when they ask is scanned when they ask, so days without a scan
  are not a loss; its row says when it was last scanned instead. One whose user
  chose regular scans rings like any other. A walled company without consent is not scanned at all,
  and neither is one on a source operator policy denies
  (`source_policy.scanned_automatically`).
- **Stale or empty.** No full scan for `coverage_stale_after_days`, or a
  careers page that answered with an empty list, which rings at once: a
  moved page is lost coverage from the first day. So does
  a careers page gone from its address: the company moved it, and
  waiting until it is stale only delays the one thing that fixes it, which is the
  person pointing RoleBand at the new page or unfollowing.
- **One notice for an outage.** When enough followed companies are stale at
  once (`binding_attention.is_outage`), the cause is ours, not theirs: one
  notice names how many, instead of one per company. Empty boards still ring
  on their own. Most of one provider's boards gone at once are the
  provider's answer more likely than that many companies moving
  (`missing_burst`): they ring only once stale, with the outage notice.

Reconciled, not appended, exactly like `pursuit_due.py`: each pass rewrites the
set of open `coverage` rows to match the report. A company scanned in full
again, unfollowed, or covered by an outage notice loses its row in the same
transaction that would otherwise re-assert it, and a lasting problem refreshes
its row in place ("· 4 days" becomes "· 5 days") without ringing again, since
`created_at` and `read_at` are not refreshable.
