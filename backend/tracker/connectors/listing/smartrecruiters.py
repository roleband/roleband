"""SmartRecruiters — one family, two routes.

**Board route, `smartrecruiters` (preferred).** The career page SmartRecruiters
publishes for job seekers, `careers.smartrecruiters.com/{token}`. It serves no
robots file (the host 302s `/robots.txt` to `jobs.smartrecruiters.com`, which
answers 404 with an HTML page), so it is not walled. Postings are grouped,
usually by location; some tenants group by department, and then each
posting prints its own place on the line a location board uses for employment
(`board_grouping`):

* the index page carries `data-groups-pages="N"` and the first groups; a board
  with no openings carries neither, only its no-openings notice;
* `/{token}/api/groups?page=1..N-1` returns the rest, and page N is empty;
* each group states its size (`<section data-qty="Q">`) but lists at most ~9
  postings, then a "Show more jobs" link: `/{token}/api/more?type=location&
  value=...&page=P`. Page `data-page` repeats what the group already showed, so
  paging starts at `data-page + 1`.

Completeness is proved per group: every group must list exactly the postings
it states. Descriptions come
from each posting's page on `jobs.smartrecruiters.com` (schema.org microdata),
fetched only in `hydrate()`, i.e. only for kept postings.

Each group page is read and its groups completed before the next page is
asked for, so a read always holds a place to continue from (`resume_point`):
the last page whose groups are all finished, by its number and by its groups'
headings and postings. Only the directory scan continues a read
(`resume_from`); the collector always reads from page one.

**API route, `smartrecruiters_api` (fallback).** The documented Posting API on
`api.smartrecruiters.com`, whose robots allows only `LinkedInBot` and gives
every other agent `Disallow: /`. So this route is WALLED: collected
only for a company whose user consented. It exists for tenants whose board is
not published on SmartRecruiters at all (the board root redirects to the
tenant's own career site), which the board route cannot read.

**The switch.** Each route checks the board root before it collects:

* the board route finds the board redirected off SmartRecruiters -> the
  company moves to the API route;
* the API route finds the board published -> the company moves back.

Either raises `RouteMoved`: that run is `unattempted` (no evidence about the
source, no closure), the pipeline records the new route on the company
(`company_store.record_route`), and the next run scans it under that route's
own policy. A company moving onto the walled route therefore waits for the
user's consent, and appears on Settings with the consent dialog like any other
walled company. Both routes name postings by the same id, so the company keeps
its jobs across a move; the new route's binding withholds closure until a
complete listing validates it, exactly as for any rebind.

        is asked for, so a read always holds a place it can continue from.
        A page number alone is no address: pages shift as groups
        come and go. The board's order is its own (a locale collation, never
        ours to recompute), and paging slices it without gaps, so the place
        is just after the last group the read finished. A group added before
        it pushes it onto the next page, which is read anyway; none, or one
        removed, leaves it on its own page. Not found on either, the read
        starts over. A group is known by its heading AND a posting it listed:
        headings repeat, and taking a new group for a finished one would skip
        it while the read still claimed the board whole.
