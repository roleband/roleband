"""Provenance registry for code copied from upstream projects.

RoleBand installs no scraper engine (Scrapling is not a backend dependency),
and the only upstream code here is *vendored* — a RoleBand
snapshot reimplemented on our own engine, updated by ordinary reviewed change
and never by dependency automation. That policy is right, and it has one failure
mode: a snapshot nobody can tell is stale. Upstream fixes silently never arrive,
and nothing in the build notices.

So each vendored artifact records where it came from, pinned to an immutable ref
and the **sha256 of the exact upstream blob** at that ref.
`scripts.check_vendored_upstream` re-fetches and compares; the hash is what makes
"has upstream moved?" a decidable question instead of a memory.

The pin is on the artifact, not on the release, deliberately. Upstream ships
releases that do not touch the file we copied, and a checker that fired on
every tag would be noise, which is how a check stops being read.

Registered here rather than in a docstring because prose provenance rots
unverified. A hash does not.
