"""The prompt the EXPERIMENTAL self-test uses, and its version.

The disclosed-comp pass reaches no model, so `INSTRUCTIONS` and
`build_prompt` are consumed only by `intelligence.selftest` (Settings >
Experimental). They are kept unchanged on purpose: the self-test asks Apple's
model exactly the prompt the model-written `disclosed_comp/v5` bands came from,
so its answers stay comparable to them.

`PROMPT_VERSION` does not gate re-extraction: the text pass stamps and compares
`pay_disclosure.PAY_PARSER_VERSION`, and every band records who wrote it
(`jobs.disclosed_source`). `disclosed_comp/v5` is the stamp on bands the model
path wrote.

The posting text is UNTRUSTED scraped content. It is fenced in explicit sentinels
and the model is told the fenced text is data to extract from, never commands.
Real safety comes from `schema.coerce_disclosed_comp` (structural + grounding
validation), not from the wording here — this only reduces the attack surface.
