"""Normalize free-form posting location strings into canonical city labels.

Sources phrase the same office a dozen ways — "Mountain View, CA, USA",
"United States, California, Mountain View", "Mountain View, California, USA" —
and multi-office postings join them with "|". `normalize_cities` collapses all
of that into stable display labels ("Mountain View, CA", "London, UK",
"Remote (US)") that `jobs.location_cities` stores and the per-company offices
view aggregates. Purely lexical; unknown-but-parseable strings degrade to a
tidied "City, Region" rather than disappearing. Country-only and
"Multiple Locations" strings yield nothing (they are not an office).

Coarse location *groups* (silicon_valley/uk/singapore, the scope-filter axis)
are a separate concept: `LOCATION_GROUPS` below (`tracker.config` re-exports
it).
