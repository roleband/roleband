"""Every category an opt-in setting has shipped, and what became of it.

Roles, seniority bands, career tracks and locations are stored as the slugs a
user switched ON. That is right for what they are, short lists of things the
user picked, and it is why a category added later arrives OFF: a new country or
role family switched on for everyone would widen boards with things nobody
asked for.

It is wrong for a category that is RENAMED or SPLIT. The stored slug stops
matching anything, the setting reads without it, and whatever the user had on
silently turns off. This registry makes the repair a declaration instead of a
hand-written migration: a retired slug names its heirs, and a stored setting is
read through them (`carry_forward`), so a split `director_plus` turns on both of
its replacements for everyone who had it on. `tests/test_slug_history.py` fails
a slug that leaves the taxonomy without an entry here.

It also says what is NEW to a user. A save records the full list the user saw
(`settings_store`); a setting saved before that existed saw the frozen
`baseline`. A current slug outside what the user saw is new, and the scope
catalog marks it until the next save.

Pure data, no tracker imports: the live slug lists are compared against it by
the test, never read here.
