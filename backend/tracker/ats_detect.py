"""Resolve what a careers-page URL IS, and separately whether we may collect it.

Two questions, deliberately not one. `detect_surface()` answers "what surface is
this?" and `detect_ats()` answers "which connector may collect it?" — the second
being the collectable-only view of the first. Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, Workable,
SmartRecruiters, Deel, Oracle, Avature (on `*.avature.net`), Workday and Google
DeepMind's board are collectable. A family whose tenant is on the tenant's own
host (Jibe, Radancy, Avature on `jobs.ea.com`) carries no marker in its URL and
needs page detection. Everything else returns None; the caller records the company as
`status="pending"` (adapter needed) rather than pretending it scrapes.

Splitting the two is the point rather than an abstraction: detection
confers neither permission nor readiness. A family recognised before it is
onboarded, or while its provider is under review, must not start collecting
because a URL matched; that is `SurfaceReadiness.CANDIDATE`. Every family
recognised here is collectable; the state is kept for the next one that is
recognised before it is onboarded.

Pure/stdlib-only so it is unit-testable without a DB or network.
