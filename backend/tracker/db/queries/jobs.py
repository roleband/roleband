    text, an agent's phrase and window): applied to the row here unless
    `row_matched` (the caller's ranked sources already admit by exactly it),
    and always asked of the peer that may represent the row's place set.
    `collapse=False` leaves the one-row-per-set rule to the caller, which
    applies it over a match set SQL cannot express (`one_per_place_set`).
