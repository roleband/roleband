"""The stored per-level pay rows the comp estimate reads.

One read per pipeline run, handed to `comp_providers.table.ReferenceTableProvider`,
which is pure and imports no database code.

Every reader of `company_comp_level`, `company_benefit` and
`external_comp_observation` filters through its scope (`level_scope`,
`benefit_scope`, `reported_rows`): a retired row is never read, and only the
ONE source answering the slot is (`Providers.where`): the selected plugin's rows
for the companies it has read whole, or ours, never both and never one filling
in for the other per family, cell or company.

A plugin's rung is banded when it is READ (`banded`): our
atlas places its label (`levels.words.rung_band`), and its stored row, which
holds what the plugin sent, is never re-banded in place. A row of ours keeps the
band it was entered with. So a reader selects `level_label`, `aliases` and
`provider`, never filters `band` in SQL, and filters it after banding.

Every rung is for one country, read with it (`banded`): the country the
plugin stated, or ours (`OUR_PAY_COUNTRY`) on a row of ours. A plugin's rung
that states none is for no country we can name, so no posting reads it. A
reader that prices one posting keeps only its country's rows.

`keep` is a reader's value filter (a band, a total, a base, a split), applied in
Python after the scope: a plugin rung that states a total but no base is simply
not a base, never a reason to read another source's base beside it. The reads
that filter by value live here (`pay_level_rows`, `package_rows`).
