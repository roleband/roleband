"""Followed companies RoleBand has not scanned in full lately.

Closure keeps no company health: a failed scan starts each posting's absence
count again, so nothing holds a company's postings that a person needs to
release. What a person can lose is coverage: a company they follow whose
careers page no scan has read in full for days. This report is built from scan
runs only, and answers per followed company:

- **When was it last read in full.** `last_full_scan_at` is the newest
  reconcile that read the whole board: `ok`, `empty`, or `lossy` (a rounding
  error of rows lost; incomplete for closure, but the page was read).
  None when no scan ever has; the clock then runs from when the binding was
  made, so a company followed today is not stale.
- **Is that too long.** `stale` once `stale_after`
  (`Settings.coverage_stale_after_days`, passed in by the caller) has passed.
- **Why.** Read off the newest reconcile since then that did not read the
  board in full (`cause_of`): unreachable, empty, read only in part, or gone
  from its address.
- **Is the board gone.** A newest reconcile whose board root answered 404 or
  410 (`outcome.board_missing`) flags the company however fresh, like an empty
  board: the company moved its careers page, and no number of days changes
  that.
- **Is the board empty.** A board whose newest reconcile
  proved it lists nothing is flagged however fresh, with `empty_since` (the
  first run of the current empty streak) and `listed_before` (the rows the
  newest scan that read any found).
- **Is it scanned automatically.** Some providers are scanned only when the
  user asks, a walled company only with consent, and nothing behind a paused
  or denied provider; `automatic` says so, from a predicate
  the caller passes plus the provider's state, and the Coverage notification
  rings only for those.

Scope: the ACTIVE binding of each FOLLOWED company (`is_followed`), chosen as
`db.binding.get_active_binding` chooses it. An unfollowed company is scanned by
nobody and costs nobody anything. `unattempted` runs are no evidence.

Like `schedule_status.py`, nothing here reads the clock or the settings.
