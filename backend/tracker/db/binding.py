"""Source binding resolution + closure scoping.

This module answers one question the pipeline must never get wrong: **which
jobs is this run allowed to close by absence?**

The dual-read rule
------------------
Closure is scoped to source identities, and a job may exist without one. Two
failure modes follow:

- scope closure to identities only -> jobs without an identity never close,
  stale postings accumulate forever;
- silently fall back to `company` + `seen_keys` -> a binding change lets one
  source close postings another source owns.

A job with no identity under any binding is closable *only* by a binding that
is both `stable` and `authoritative`; a job owned by a different binding is never
closable. A non-stable binding closes nothing, ever.

# Activation: how a withheld binding earns closure authority
#
# `plan_binding_seeds` creates every new binding `stable`/`none`: it collects,
# and closes nothing. This is the promotion path that grants the authority
# afterwards, without which a newly onboarded company's postings stay open
# forever.
#
# The evidence is the same evidence closure itself depends on: one reconcile
# that enumerated the board to a natural stop with no errors (`SourceOutcome.OK`)
# and saw rows. That proves the binding's connector and board token really do
# enumerate this tenant's listing.
#
# What it does NOT prove is that the tenant is the right *company*: a
# wrong-but-live board token answers 200 with somebody else's complete listing
# and satisfies every rule below. Nothing automatic can close that gap; it stays
# with the onboarding checks, `detect_ats()` resolving the token from the
# company's own careers URL, and `scripts.check_catalog_tokens`. What this gate
# prevents is a token nobody has checked carrying closure authority from the
# moment it is typed.

#: non-authoritative by construction, and repair/shadow re-read a subset of the

    Split from its writes like `decide_closure_scope`, and for the same reason —
    this is the second function in the repo that can hand a source the right to
    close jobs by absence, so its branches are asserted on explicit inputs.

    Rules (top-down, first match wins). The first three are about the row, the
    rest about the run:

    1. nothing is withheld — already `authoritative`, so there is no decision;
    2. not an adapter binding, unless it is a recipe pinned to a revision
       RoleBand itself validated (`revision_validated`) — a recipe
       earns authority through the validated-revision flow, never from a
       run outcome alone. Without this rule a recipe author could grant
       themselves closure authority by shipping a recipe that enumerates
       cleanly, which is exactly what `SourceBinding`'s "assigned by RoleBand
       validation, never by recipe text" forbids. A validated recipe still has
       to pass every rule below, like an adapter;
    3. not `stable` — a `proposed`/`reconciling` binding is mid-lifecycle and
       promotion belongs to that lifecycle, not here;
    4. not a reconcile — see `_VALIDATING_SCAN_MODE`;
    5. outcome is not `OK` — anything else is an incomplete, errored, capped or
       bounded listing. Note this also excludes `unattempted`, so a
       policy-denied source can never activate anything;
    6. `scanned` is zero — an empty board is a *separate* question with its own
       two-confirmation contract, and an empty response must never be
       mistaken for proof that a board exists. A zero-row listing is never
       complete (`SchemaDriftDetector.settle_listing`) and a board proven
       empty classifies `empty`, so rule 5 catches this first; the rule is
       explicit anyway so it holds if rule 5 stops catching it.
