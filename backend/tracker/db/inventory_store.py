"""The posting inventory's only writer.

`write_inventory` keeps one company's rows current after a scan: every row the
scan read is upserted, a listed key the source could not build
(`present_only`) keeps its row alive, and only an authoritative listing marks
the rest gone. Current state, never history: `first_seen_at` is set once,
`gone_at` clears on reappearance.

A steady board costs no row churn: an upsert rewrites a row only when its
content changed, it was gone, or its last touch is older than the touch window.
Commits nothing; the caller holds the company's transaction. The one writer
that commits is `reclassify_inventory`, which rewrites the whole table after a
classifier change and so saves chunk by chunk.

Retention: `remove_unread` deletes rows no scan has read since a
cutoff, and `retention_counts` counts them with the same clause, so what
Settings says is due is what a run removes. One rule covers every case the user
means: a posting that leaves its listing stops being read, and so does every
posting of a company that is unfollowed or untracked.
