"""How a role arrived: whether our first sighting of a posting dates it.

A role's first sighting S is the earlier of its creation here and the
inventory's `first_seen_at` for the same posting (a read that held it out of
scope, or a "Count now"). `first_seen` becomes S.

The sighting dates the posting only if the company was already known at S:

- a read of it that saw its whole listing (`list_complete`, or a board proven
  `empty`) finished before S, inside the retention window before S. A company
  followed again after the window starts over, as its inventory rows did.
- a source that has never completed a read is known after two earlier reads
  that kept postings and stopped only at our own ceilings or a few unreadable
  records (`truncated`, `bounded`, `lossy`). Operator caps, a sleeping host and
  a broken source are not evidence of what the board held.

`finished_at < S` excludes the read that produced S: its source-run row is
written after its upserts and its inventory write.

Then `arrival` is `first_read` when the company was not known at S,
`Arrival.SIGHTED_EARLIER` when the posting was on the board before we stored
it (S before creation, or admitted from the inventory), and `new` otherwise
(`schema.Arrival`).

One statement classifies a batch, and every writer of `jobs` calls it on the
rows it created, in the same transaction: no reader sees an unclassified role
the writer made. Commits nothing.
