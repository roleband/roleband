"""Table-ownership registry — every DB table declares who populates it.

The bug class: a derived-data producer ships as a standalone CLI, its
consumer API ships, but nothing ever wires it into the scrape pipeline, so the
table stays empty and no test notices. This registry is the structural fix.
`tests/test_table_ownership.py` asserts that every table in
``Base.metadata`` is claimed here exactly once, so adding a model *forces* a
claim declaring its populator — the same gate mechanism as
``blueprint.py``/``test_company_blueprint.py``.

A claim is one of:

* ``core`` — written by the pipeline's persist stage, the recipes/binding
  engine, company/profile bootstrapping, or notifications. Populated every run
  as part of the scrape itself, not a post-pass.
* ``post_pass:<name>`` — produced by a POST_PASSES entry. ``<name>`` must match
  a registered pass, so a renamed/removed pass fails the gate.
* ``user`` — user-driven mutations (favorites, pursuits, settings).
* ``manual:<route>`` — populated only by an explicit API-triggered refresh.
  ``<route>`` must exist in the frozen route table, so the trigger can't
  silently disappear.
* ``seed`` — one-time reference data loaded by a script.
* ``infra`` — operational bookkeeping, not domain data.
* ``planned:<note>`` — schema exists ahead of its feature; intentionally
  unpopulated. Explicit so "no writer" reads as a decision, not an oversight.

Each entry is a ``TableOwnership``, so the registry answers "where is this
written, where is it read, and how do its rows age?" without a grep.

**Its three other fields are not all the same kind of statement, and confusing
them would be worse than not having them.** `tests/test_table_writers.py` scans the
code and can only ever prove a declaration WRONG, never complete:

* ``writers`` is meant to be exhaustive. The scan asserts every writer it finds
  is declared here, so an undeclared one fails by name. It cannot prove a
  declared writer is real, and it cannot see a row reached through a function's
  return value: a getter that hands back a row its caller then mutates is
  invisible to an AST scan.
* ``readers`` is the read OWNER — where to look first — NOT every reader.
  `jobs` is queried across the codebase; listing every reader would be
  unreadable and would churn on every refactor. The one reader claim that IS checked is the empty
  one: ``readers=()`` asserts nothing reads the table, and the scan fails it if
  anything does.
* ``lifecycle`` is how rows age, which the claim does not say: `jobs` and
  `job_observations` are both ``core``, and one is upserted in place while the
  other is history that must never be overwritten (AGENTS.md, "Data safety").
  Only ``append_only`` is enforced, and only in one direction: the scan fails
  an ``append_only`` table if it finds an update, delete or upsert, but
  silence is not proof.

Keep this map in sync with reality: a new derived table is a ``post_pass``
claim plus a POST_PASSES entry in the same change, never a bare model.
