"""Every other company RoleBand can scan.

`COMPANY_DISCOVERY` is the product's recommendation: a short list per sector,
each one a decision. This is the rest of the market RoleBand can read, thousands
of live boards on the families it already collects (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever,
Workable, SmartRecruiters), none of them a decision. It exists so
a user can FIND any of them by name and follow the whole set in one switch; it
is never shown as a list.

**Data, rebuilt by a reviewed change.** `company_directory.json` is written by
`scripts.discover_board_tokens --directory`, which keeps only boards that
answered live at build time.
Nothing at runtime writes it. A board that has closed since is an ordinary dead
board at follow time, and the monthly rebuild drops it.

**A name is the board's, or it is marked.** Greenhouse, Workable and
SmartRecruiters state whose board it is; Ashby and Lever do not, and their
names are read off the board address (`named_by="address"`), which the product
says rather than presenting a guess as a fact.

**Slugs never collide with a company we already have.** The builder reserves
every `COMPANY_DISCOVERY`, `CATALOG` and built-in slug and every board we
already collect, so a directory row is never a second copy of one of those;
`tests/test_company_directory.py` holds the file to that.
