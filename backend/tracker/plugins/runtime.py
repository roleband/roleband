"""When plugin jobs run, and how the supervisor is asked to run them.

A plugin job runs in its own process, `tracker.plugins.cli run`, which is the
host (`host.run_job`): never inside the API, the scheduler tick or the pipeline,
which never import the plugin SDK. The supervisor starts it, one run per plugin
at a time, when asked (`spawn_run` rings a `plugin_run` request). Three things
ask:

- the supervisor's `plugins_due` job (`plugins_when_due`), for every scheduled
  job that is due. It never asks in a maintenance wake, and a scheduled run
  waits for mains power;
- Sync (`POST /api/sync`), for the same due jobs; work the user starts skips
  the mains gate, never the dark-wake gate;
- Refresh now (`POST /api/plugins/{id}/refresh`), for one job, due or not.

**Due** (`due_jobs`, pure, over `schedule.next_start`): runnable, not paused,
the job's schedule (the user's choice, else the manifest's) is not `manual`,
nothing of this plugin is running, and the job's next start has come: never
run; a pass in progress (a clean or partial run that said `more`)
`CONTINUE_AFTER` its last run; an attempt that did not go through
`RETRY_AFTER` it; else one interval (a day, a week, 30 days) after the start of its last whole pass. Re-enabling a plugin that has
a clean snapshot fetches nothing: its rows answer again at once.

**Liveness** is a PID plus its command, never a PID alone: a `running` row
whose process is gone is closed `error` by `reconcile_dead_runs`, so a killed
runner never blocks the next one. Disable cancels the plugin's queued requests,
asks the supervisor to stop its run, and sends the host SIGTERM (`stop_runs`),
which also reaches a run started by hand: the run ends `stopped`. A company it had already published whole stays read, its rows
not repeated already retired at that publish; nothing after is.
