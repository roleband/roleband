"""The core's plugin host: run one job of one plugin out of process and answer it.

The plugin runs the SDK runner in its own venv's interpreter, isolated (`-I`:
no current directory, user site-packages or PYTHON* variables on its path),
started in a directory it cannot write, with an environment that carries no
database address and no key of ours; nothing it can write is on its import path.
It talks to this host over stdio; the host:

- answers every call through `roleband_plugin_sdk.policy`, the same checks the
  SDK's fake host makes, so what passes a plugin's own tests passes here;
- performs every request itself: https only, declared hosts only, the
  identified client with our User-Agent (any other identity needs a consent the
  core cannot record), the host's `robots.txt` honoured unless the user allowed
  the plugin past that file, paced on one shared
  limiter per plugin at no less than the core's delay, retried by the core's
  policy, and bounded by the job's budget on a `SourceClock`;
- writes each publish in its own transaction (`writer.write_batch`); a
  facts publish leaves the profile alone, whose columns are ours only;
- decides the outcome itself (`clean`, `partial`, `bounded`, `stopped`,
  `error`). A company published whole is read, and retires the rows this run
  did not repeat for it, at that publish, whatever the run's end;
- records, once a run that published anything has closed, where the stored
  estimates go (`reestimate.begin`), so the status says they are updating.

This module imports the plugin SDK, so it runs only in the detached host
process (`tracker.plugins.cli run`, which the supervisor starts and
`scripts.plugin run` runs by hand), never in the API or the pipeline.
