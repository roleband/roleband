"""Re-estimate every stored job when the reference set changes.

A job's estimate is a function of its stored fields (company, band, family,
location group, title) and the reference data the resolver reads. When that
data changes, every stored estimate moves at once: a plugin enabled, disabled
or refreshed clean, a core levels refresh, a new atlas edition, a change to
the estimate code. Recorded per job as `changed` events, such a move would flood
the history, so the moves happen together, in batches, and are recorded once,
as one `reference_change` with a moved report.

**The reference fingerprint** is sha256 over:
- `builtin_fingerprint()`: the estimate's own code and the atlas files it reads,
  as shipped, hashed by content, never by a version string;
- the provider set of every slot (readers take every slot from the
  applied set, so a benefits or company-size switch is applied by the same
  flip), with how far each active plugin's coverage reached (the companies read
  whole);
- the exact rows the estimate reads (`pay_level_rows`), so a core-written
  refresh, a retirement or a re-banding moves it too.
The benefits dataset never enters it: benefits never enter an estimate, so a
new benefits edition never re-estimates a job.

**`reestimate`** follows `retention.apply_retention`: each batch commits, with
`take_lock` it takes the run lock per batch and yields to a run that holds it,
and a cursor keyed by the target fingerprint survives a stop (a different
target restarts it). Open and closed jobs alike: lineage diffs compare
reposts. A batch writes only each source's own row (`job_comp_estimate`);
the copy every list, sort and filter reads (`jobs.comp_*`) does not move.
The last batch copies the selected source's rows onto every job, flips
`reference_state.applied_fp`, recomputes today's `comp_metrics` /
`comp_snapshot` and writes the `reference_change`, all in one transaction.
So every reader, a list or a detail, sees the old set or the new
one, never half: a list read mid-switch is all the old source. While a switch
moves, the dashboard says estimates are updating, and
`/api/status.reference.pending_jobs` counts the jobs the batches have not
reached yet.

Four callers, one function: the pipeline before collection and its
`reference` post pass (the run holds the lock: `take_lock=False`), the
scheduler's idle branch (`reestimate_when_idle`), and `reestimate_cli` (the
supervisor's `reestimate` job, and `scripts.reestimate` by hand).
