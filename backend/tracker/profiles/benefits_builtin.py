"""Benefits from our own dataset, or from the one plugin answering them.

Our source for `company.benefits` is the benefits dataset (`benefits_dataset/`),
read here from its two files, in memory and read-only: no seed, no
`company_benefit` row, no network. `observations.jsonl` is the dataset itself,
one evidence record per line, edited in place when the data changes;
`taxonomy.json` names the types and categories. The runtime never writes either.

**One source answers, never both.** While a plugin is selected for `company.benefits` the profile shows
its rows only (`plugin_benefits`), and a company it has not read shows none of
ours in their place. With no plugin selected it shows the dataset only
(`dataset_benefits`). Turning a plugin off brings the dataset back unchanged:
nothing here reads one source to shape the other.
- a plugin row whose name no taxonomy alias maps is kept under its own name, in
  `other`, never dropped (the dataset's own rule is to fail on an unseen label;
  a reader shows what it cannot classify instead);
- a benefit with no evidence record is unknown and not listed at all: unknown
  is not "not offered", and a profile says what is known.

Per-perk values are kept per row and never summed into a total.
