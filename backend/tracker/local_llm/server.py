"""Start and stop the locally-installed oMLX managed server.

Only oMLX is controllable, and only when its CLI is actually on this Mac: the
binary is resolved with `shutil.which`, never assumed. A profile pointing at
some other OpenAI-compatible server is reported `managed=False` — we did not
start it and must not claim we can stop it.

Safety shape, deliberately narrow: a FIXED argv (`<resolved omlx> start|stop`)
with no shell, no user-supplied arguments, and no environment inheritance
games. Nothing a profile contains reaches the command line, so a malicious
profile value cannot become an argument.

`omlx start` daemonizes its own managed server and returns; we therefore wait
for the CLI to exit (bounded) rather than tracking a PID. Whether the server is
actually ANSWERING is a separate question with a separate answer — the HTTP
probe in `reachable()` — because a CLI that exited 0 is not proof that a model
loaded.
