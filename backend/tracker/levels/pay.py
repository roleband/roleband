"""How each company constructs an offer, and the pay each rung reads.

Each company's policy is data (`tracker/levels/atlas/company_facts.csv`, one fact
per row, each saying who states it); this module reads it. The rules the package is
modelled on:

1. **Base** is the posted band. A fact when the posting says "base"; see
   `intelligence.schema.derive_pay_basis`.
2. **Bonus is a percentage of base, set by level, by policy**, or there is none.
   `comp_package` scales it off base. A company whose policy is no annual bonus gets
   none: a heuristic that invents one for it is wrong by construction.
3. **Equity is a dollar amount sized by level, never a multiple of base.** It comes
   from its own per-level budget; at some companies a higher base means less equity
   for the same target total. Scaling equity off the two ends of a posted base band
   manufactures a spread out of geography. The estimator is the measured per-level
   grant with equity's OWN uncertainty, the most negotiated component: the centre is
   knowable, the band must be wide and labelled.
4. **Year-1 cash is not annualised equity.** Vesting schedules and sign-on cash
   differ by company. The package shows annualised equity ("per year, vests over
   time"); a year-1 view is a different, also-legitimate number.
5. **No same-company, same-level family premium.** Scientist and engineer ladders at
   one company and rung pay alike; the premium that exists is between companies
   (already in their own rows) and in the tail (band width). Never add a family
   multiplier. At a company with no annual bonus, a measured "bonus" is one-time
   sign-on cash, not annual.

Per-RUNG facts (seed pay, bonus target) live on the rungs; every per-band answer
below is read through `ladder.rung_for_band`, so pay is keyed by rung, never by band.
A field left None is "unverified", which the UI must treat as unknown, never as zero.
