"""The background scan of every other company RoleBand can scan.

Following the whole directory cannot mean a followed row per directory
company: the scheduler's daily capacity is far smaller than the directory, and
the register would become the list it exists not to be. So the set is ONE
setting, and this pass does the work behind it:

1. read each directory company's board, most-linked first, one paced lane per
   job site, side by side;
2. count the postings that fit what the user's radar looks for: the same
   `annotate` + `passes_filters` gate the pipeline applies, read through
   `workflows.scope_filter` so the two cannot drift;
3. a company with at least one is FOLLOWED (`source="directory-set"`), and from
   then on the scheduler collects it like any company the user follows.

It stores no postings and closes nothing: the pipeline remains the one writer of
`jobs`, and a followed company earns closure authority the usual way.
What it keeps is `directory_checks` (when each company was read and what was
found), which is what makes it resumable, what makes a company due again a day
later, and what the register's progress line counts.

Its own process and lock (`data/directory.lock`, the supervisor's `directory`
job, `python -m tracker.workflows.directory_sweep`),
never `daily.lock`: a pass holding the scheduler's lock would delay every scan
the user starts by its whole budget. One process runs passes back to back while
companies are due: the supervisor starts the next process at the first
ten-minute mark after this one EXITS, so one pass per process would leave the
scan idle most of the time.

Each lane runs at its host's pacer (`provider_pacing`), not at the board's
speed, so the slowest-paced job site sets how long a full circle takes.
Reading only the places the radar can keep shortens the boards that page
by place.

A read our host cuts (asleep, or no job site answering) is never the board's
verdict. A role found before the cut follows the company at once; a
read that found none leaves a `Cursor`, and a later pass of the same run
continues it from the place it held instead of from page one.
