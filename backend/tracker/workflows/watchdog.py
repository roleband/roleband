"""Health checks for the supervisor's `health` job.

The supervisor owns API recovery and backup scheduling, including wake catch-up.
This pass records unhealthy conditions, recovers embedded Postgres, reconciles
orphaned runs, stops a scan that reads no further, and queues a scan when data
is stale.

Backup failures are alert-only here: an immediate retry can repeat the backup
script's empty-database refusal. A state file suppresses repeated desktop alerts
while a condition persists.
