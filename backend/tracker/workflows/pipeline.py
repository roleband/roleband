"""Daily pipeline: scrape -> enrich -> filter -> persist -> demand rollup.

For each enabled company we pull the (cheap) job list, annotate and filter to
level-6+ target-family target-location roles, hydrate descriptions only for
keepers, resolve comp, and upsert with full longitudinal bookkeeping. Then we
recompute demand metrics and finalize the run log.

This module is the run's assembly: scope and targets, the run
lock, the heartbeat, the stages in order, and guaranteed finalization. The stages
own their work: `collection` (network, no DB session), `run_persistence`
(per-source writes and the terminal record), `post_passes` (derived data), with
the shared shapes in `collection_types`.

Transaction map. One `session_scope` session owns every write below. Collection
holds no session; the heartbeat writes through its own short-lived sessions.

1. Advisory run lock on a connection of its own, wait-retrying briefly. Not
   acquired: return `skipped`, no run row.
2. COMMIT the stale-run reconciliation and the `running` marker. `run_pk` is read
   here, while loaded, so no later rollback can turn reading it into
   MissingGreenlet. The heartbeat starts once the row has an id.
3. COMMIT builtins, source bindings, company profiles, the run scope corrected
   from coverage, the sync-started notification and zero-state progress. The
   budget, frontier and fresh-description reads follow.
4. Collection streams into `_RunWriter`, the one task that writes:
   a. COMMIT kept rows (`persist_rows`: upserts + observations) whenever the
      writer's queue runs dry, while their company is still being read;
   b. COMMIT each company when its scan ends, in completion order:
      `finalize_source` (scope flags, closure, catalog, health, source-run row),
      then the run row's running totals flushed BEFORE the progress notification
      (the lock order the heartbeat shares). Companies a crashed lane
      synthesised are finished after collection, in target order.
   Each writer transaction takes the scope lock (`repo.hold_scope_projection`)
   before its first row write and, just before its commit, re-projects the
   rows it wrote or flagged onto the scope saved now, so a save made during
   the run is never undone by it. `upsert_job` re-reads a held
   row's `source_facts` under a row lock before merging into it.
   A writer failure cancels the collection and propagates to step 7; whatever
   it committed before stays committed.
5. COMMIT per post-pass in `run_post_passes`, plus one per derivation-state
   record. A non-fatal failure rolls that pass back and continues; a fatal one
   rolls back, records itself, and raises into step 7. A pass that rewrites the
   whole table (the reclassify passes, `reestimate`) commits chunk by chunk
   inside its own boundary, so a killed run keeps the chunks it saved.
6. Success: `record_run_finished` flushes the terminal status and notifies; the
   heartbeat stops, the lock is released, and the session scope's exit commits.
7. `Exception`: `record_run_failure` rolls back first (the session may be
   pending-rollback), reloads the run by `run_pk`, records `error`, notifies and
   commits; the original exception is re-raised.
8. Always: cancel and await the heartbeat, then release the lock (a failed
   unlock invalidates the lock's connection, which frees it). Cancellation
   is not an `Exception`: no terminal status is written here, and the `running`
   row goes silent for the stale-run reconciler, or is ended by the cancel route
   as the projection of the sources already committed.
