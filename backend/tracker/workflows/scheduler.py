"""Provider-aware due-work scheduler.

One short invocation:

1. reconcile built-ins/bindings + seed missing schedule/provider rows;
2. select overdue work, round-robin across providers, up to each provider's
   declared `provider_pacing.max_boards_in_flight`;
3. run one small pipeline shard (<= `sync_scheduler_max_bindings`);
4. persist next due times + cross-run provider cooldown.

A provider's boards are queue depth, not parallelism: `collect_sources` drains
one backend's companies serially behind the pacer they all share, so a deeper
shard retires more of the roster without raising anyone's request rate.

Discovery is capped, no-hydrate, and `ScanMode.DISCOVERY`; the pipeline itself
refuses closure and activation in that mode. Reconciliation is the existing
complete source path. The process holds `data/daily.lock`, so scheduler,
manual, `tracker.daily` and targeted retry runs stay one writer.

    Reconciliation outranks discovery because it is the closure/freshness

    a hard gate, never a score a high-yield source may override.

    **Several bindings per provider.** One binding per provider per tick
    starves a roster whose companies sit mostly on one shared job site: its
    tenants would share a few slots a day while `collect_sources`, built for
    exactly this, sat idle. It admits backends concurrently and drains each
    backend's companies SERIALLY behind one shared pacer, and a queue of length
    1 never reaches the machinery that makes many boards safe.

    A provider contributes up to `pacing_for(provider).max_boards_in_flight`.
    That is queue DEPTH, not parallelism: the boards still drain one at a time
    behind the shared pacer, so a deeper shard retires more of the roster
    without raising the provider's request rate. `RateLimiterPool` is what makes
    that a structural property rather than an intention.

    **Round-robin, so depth cannot become monopoly.** Filling greedily in due
    order would let one provider with fifty overdue tenants take every slot, and
    a provider is exactly the thing we must not concentrate load on. Each pass
    offers every eligible provider ONE binding, oldest-due first, before any
    provider gets a second, so the shard spreads across APIs by construction
    and a big family widens the shard rather than owning it.

    Two drops, both about work the dispatcher must not choose for itself:

    * **Consent**: a walled company the user has not consented to is
      not due work: the gate refuses it anyway, and leaving it in makes it
      PERMANENTLY overdue, selected every tick and taking a dispatch slot from a
      source that can actually be scanned.
    * **Direction**: a company on a `user_directed` source is collected on a
      timer only when its user's agreement chose regular scans
      (`source_policy.direction_wait`). Otherwise its work is admitted ONLY
      when this binding carries a manual request
      (`SyncScheduleState.manual_requested_at`), which is what the Sync button
      and the follow dialog write. Without that the deadline passing means
      nothing: the company waits, however overdue, rather than being scanned
      on a timer.

    Both drops are `schedule_status.waits_for_user`, the rule `/api/status`
    also reads, so a company never scanned on a timer is never counted overdue.

    An operator-denied provider is deliberately NOT dropped here: that is a
    provider-level terminal state the pressure table reports, and hiding it from
