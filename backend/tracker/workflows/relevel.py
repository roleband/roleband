"""Bring every stored job's level in line with the leveling model.

`jobs.level_band`, `level_confidence` and `level_basis` are written at scrape
time, so a ladder, title-rule or pay-grade change reaches only rows observed
again: a closed row, or one at a paused company, would keep the old band, and
the Board would disagree with the Walk. `relevel_jobs` is the
`levels_backfill` post pass; `scripts.backfill_level_bands` is its dry-run
report.

One reading for both: `stored_raw` rebuilds what `read_level` needs from the
stored columns, the stored family included (the reading the scrape gave;
`roles_backfill` runs first, so it is current). The employer's printed rung is
read from the stored description only where the employer prints one and the
column is empty, so the pass does not load every description on every run.
