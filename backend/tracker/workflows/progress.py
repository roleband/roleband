"""Live per-run scrape progress: in-memory counters published to the UI.

The pipeline runs in two phases that are invisible from the outside:

    collect_sources(...)   concurrent; writes NOTHING to the DB itself
    _RunWriter             the run's one writer, fed by collection as it reads:
                           rows as they arrive, each company as it ends

Until the persist loop starts, ``ScrapeRun.jobs_seen``/``per_source`` are zero,
so a run that is minutes deep into hydration looks identical to a stalled one.
``RunProgress`` closes that gap: collectors report starts and completions into
this object in memory, and the caller publishes snapshots (heartbeat during
collect, inline during persist) into the run's ``sync_started`` notification.

**Every aggregate is derived from the per-company map**, never incremented.
That is load-bearing, not stylistic: a company is reported by the collector hook
*and* again by the post-collect reconcile pass, so counters that were bumped by
each caller would double-count. Deriving makes the second report a no-op by
construction and makes ``companies_scraping`` honest for free, where
``total - collected`` would count every queued company as in flight even
though the collector semaphore admits at most a handful at a time.

Two orthogonal axes describe a company, and they must not be collapsed:

* ``state`` — lifecycle position (queued -> scraping -> collected -> persisting
  -> recorded). Says *where* a company is.
* ``outcome`` — a verbatim ``SourceOutcome``. Says *how it went*, and stays
  ``None`` until collection ends. This module deliberately owns no outcome
  vocabulary of its own (see ``connectors/recipes/outcome.py``).

Ownership: counters only. This module never touches the DB and never decides
run health — liveness stays with ``heartbeat_at`` and the reconciler.

Concurrency: mutated from collector tasks on one asyncio event loop, so plain
attribute assignment is atomic here. Do not share across threads/processes.
