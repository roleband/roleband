"""What a run writes: each source's persistence and the run's terminal record.

Session ownership is explicit, and no session is ever shared with
collection:

* `persist_rows` writes kept rows as they are read and `finalize_source`
  decides a source once its listing is whole; the run's writer commits both.
  `persist_source` is the two at once, and commits nothing.
* `record_run_finished` flushes the terminal status and writes the run's
  notifications; the run's session scope commits it after the heartbeat stops
  and the run lock is released.
* `record_run_failure` rolls back first, reloads the run by its id, records
  `error`, notifies and commits.

Closure authority is two gates, both applied in `persist_source`: run quality
(`scan_may_close`, over `should_close_missing`) says whether the listing is
evidence at all, and the binding's closure scope says which jobs it may speak for.
Within them a posting closes only on its second miss (`repo.record_absence`).
