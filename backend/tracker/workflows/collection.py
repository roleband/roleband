"""Source collection: fetch, filter, hydrate and enrich, holding no DB session.

`collect_sources` runs distinct backends concurrently and each backend's
companies serially, and bounds every company independently; its docstring names the three bounds and what each one
firing means. Nothing bounds the run as a whole: a slow network makes it longer,
never smaller. `collect_source` records why a source stopped and keeps the pages
already fetched. Nothing here writes: persistence receives the
`SourceCollection`s this returns.

    fetched**. Cancelling would discard them (see ``asyncio.wait_for``'s
    return-value semantics).

    A `SourceClock` additionally distinguishes *why* the source stopped. Silence
    (`stalled`) is the source's own pathology and reaches binding health; our own
    ceiling (`exhausted`) does not, because a threshold we picked is not evidence
    about the source. A bare float is a single bound.

    ``on_row`` receives each kept row the moment it is built, so the
    run's one writer can store it while the listing is still being read. An
    in-memory hand-off: no await, no DB, never allowed to fail the collection.
    The row stays in the returned collection either way.

    (`SourceLookups`; none when omitted). Its ``held_dates`` are put on each
    `RawJob` before its level is read, so a posting that states no date reads
    its pay grade for the year relevel does (`level_mapper.level_date`). They
    also name the held postings whose out-of-scope read is kept in

    ``on_source_start(company)`` fires when a company actually begins collecting,
    and ``on_source_done(company, detected, outcome, scanned)`` when it finishes,
    giving the caller live progress during a phase that writes nothing. Both are
    plain in-memory callbacks: no awaits, no DB, and never allowed to fail the
    collection (a broken progress hook must not cost a scrape).

    The pair is deliberate. A company sitting in ``targets`` is not yet working:
    the semaphore admits at most ``max_concurrent_sources`` *backends*, and each
    holds its slot while draining its own companies serially. Only the start hook
    can tell in-flight from queued, and without it a caller can do no better than
    "everything not finished is running", which is wrong by the width of the
    queue.

    Bulkheading. Each *company* is bounded independently, so a source that fails
    slowly cannot hold the run. Three bounds, and which one fires
    is itself the diagnosis:

    * ``source_stall_seconds``: sliding; a source that goes silent this long is
      **stalled**, its own pathology, and it reaches binding health;
    * ``source_budget_seconds`` (the setting when not given), tightened by a
      learned budget: absolute, and for a discovery probe only; a source still
      producing when this expires is **bounded**, our threshold talking, and
      health is untouched. A reconcile has no ceiling: it is the full read
      every closure and coverage decision waits on, so a source that keeps
      producing is read to the end of its list, however long that takes;
    * a backstop per company for a source that ignores both; discards that
      company's in-flight partial data, which is the accepted trade for a hard
      cap. Without a ceiling it slides with the source's progress, so it
      fires only on a source silent past its stall window and the grace. A
      source that then cannot even close is left behind, so its lane goes on.

    There is no bound on the run as a whole. Every company is either read or
    has a reason it was not (its lane lost the network first), however long
    the run takes: a run bound would cut the companies at the end of a slow
    person's queue and blame them for our threshold.

    The first two are enforced cooperatively through one `SourceClock`, so the
    pages already fetched always survive. That split exists because one fixed
    budget cannot tell a slow healthy source from a stuck one: it either cuts
    healthy sources every run and blames them for our threshold, or never
    bounds the stuck ones.

    Cancelling this coroutine cancels and awaits every collector before the
    cancellation propagates, so no adapter outlives the run that opened it.

    ``monotonic`` is the time every source's clock and backstop read; injected
    in tests, so a source's silence can be simulated without waiting for it.

    ``on_source_progress()`` fires on every unit of completed work of any
    source, from inside the read: a run that reads one company for hours is
    still seen to make progress. Same contract as the progress hooks.

    ``on_row(company, row)`` and ``on_collected(company, collection)`` stream
    the run to its writer: each kept row as it is read, then each
    company as it finishes. Same contract as the progress hooks: in-memory,
    never fatal. A company whose lane crashed is not announced; it is in the
    returned mapping only, and the caller finishes it from there.

    ``asked`` carries the companies a person asks for while the run reads. One
    the run has not started yet moves to the front of its lane; one outside
    the run joins it at the front of the lane for its host, or in a lane of its
    own that takes the next free slot. One the run already started or read is
    left alone: its request stays queued for the next tick.

    ``lookups`` is what the run read before collecting (`RunLookups`): each
    company is collected with its own share of it, a learned time budget can
    only tighten that company's ceiling, and the measured costs order the lanes.
