"""What the schedule IS, apart from the dispatcher that changes it.

What the connector schedule is (`/api/schedule`), and whether the tree is
fresh and what is queued (`/api/status`), are projections of stored rows: given
a roster, its bindings, their schedule rows and provider pressure, they are pure
arithmetic over a clock, testable without an HTTP request. What to dispatch is
`scheduler.py`'s. Each fact both need has one home here, so the router and the
dispatcher cannot disagree about it:

- **The blocked-provider set** (`BLOCKED_PROVIDER_STATES`). A copy missing a
  state would read a paused provider as schedulable on one surface and not on
  another.
- **Which bindings the scheduler actually dispatches** (`stable_binding_where`).
  A router listing bindings the dispatcher will never touch is worse than an
  empty list, because it looks like work in progress.
- The stuck-run count (`stuck_running_count`), the predicate
  `reconcile_stale_runs` uses, read with the caller's Python clock.

Nothing here reads the clock or the settings: both arrive as parameters, because
the ops contract pins `routers/ops.py`'s `datetime` and its settings getter, and a
projection that fetched its own would answer from the real machine inside a
pinned test (`tests/test_schedule_status.py` reads this module's AST to keep it
that way). Nor does anything here
import `tracker.workflows.scheduler`: the dependency runs the other way, since
the dispatcher uses `stable_bindings` too.

What stays in the router: HTTP status mapping, the response envelopes, the
scan requests (`api/scan_requests.py`), and `_run_stopped_by`.
