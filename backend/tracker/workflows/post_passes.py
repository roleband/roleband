"""Post-persist passes: the one producer table for every derived surface.

A table, not a plugin registry. Order is load-bearing: content_fingerprint precedes
embeddings + disclosed_comp (they gate on content_changed_at); lineage runs after
embeddings (needs fresh vectors) and before demand_metrics (reads lineage_role);
place_sets run just before lineage, whose detector gates on them;
twins run after the lineage projection so same-opening pairs never enter the
twin review queue.

`run_post_passes` owns the skip/failure policy and each pass's transaction
boundary: commit after a pass, roll back after a failure, one derivation-state
record per pass that ran. A new derived table is a `POST_PASSES` entry plus a
`post_pass:` claim in `db/ownership.py`, in the same change.

    is not stated goes ahead: its text is what can name its
    level (a stated range, `levels_backfill` reads it), and until then the

    Only rows this pass can fill are selected, so `limit` counts them:
    a followed company (`get_active_targets`) the source policy
    lets us collect (`collection_access`, with the user's consent for a walled
    one), whose adapter reads a posting's text from the posting alone
    (`text_from_posting`). Selecting the oldest blanks and skipping the ones
    no adapter can fill would let unfillable rows hold the head of the queue
    every run, so no newer blank is ever reached.

    A company scanned only when the user asks (`scanned_automatically`) is
    asked only by a run that scanned it, `collected`, which for such a
    company is a sync the user started: this drain runs after every run,
    scheduled ones included, and must not make one of them reach it. An
    adapter whose `hydrate` needs the listing's payload is fillable only
    because it rebuilds that payload from the posting url
    (`payload_from_posting`).

    Every fetch is individually guarded: this runs after persistence, drains a
    backlog, and must never be able to fail a scrape that already succeeded.

    It owns its transactions, as the first pass may. Each fetch is a paced
    request, so a transaction held across the drain would keep one snapshot
    open for the whole of it, holding back vacuum and every writer waiting on
    this run. The queue is read and that transaction ended before the first
