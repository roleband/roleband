"""Read the posting page where the listing left something out.

A listing can carry every posting's text but not its application form or its
structured pay. Those live on the posting's own page, one request each. Most
postings already state pay in their text, so the page is read in the
background only where it adds what the text lacks:

    open, on the radar, the text pass found no band, a company we collect
    (active, enabled, allowed by the source policy, a page-reading connector),
    a posting id, and the page not read since the text last changed nor
    failed within `posting_page_retry_hours` (nor answered that it does not
    exist since the text last changed).

That is the queue, as a query, drained a bounded
number per run and best effort per posting, like the description backfill.
Every other posting's form is read when someone opens it, under the
same company and posting gate minus the radar and pay conditions.

What a read stores: the form as COUNTS in `source_facts.application_form`, the
tiers in `source_facts.compensation` (each with a period from the one rule),
and, when there is exactly one tier with a known period and the text
stated no band, the posting's band in `disclosed_*`, the same columns the text
pass fills. A band read from the page carries no snippet: the page states
numbers in a field, not a sentence, and a snippet is shown as the employer's
own words (`band_from_page`). A read that moves a band an earlier read stated
records the move, as every writer of a band does (`_record_move`).

Transactions: no read holds one across a request. The rows to read are
selected, the transaction ends, the page is fetched, and the row is loaded
again under a row lock and written, one commit per posting, so a scan that
commits in between keeps its facts and no pooled connection idles in a
transaction while a source answers.
